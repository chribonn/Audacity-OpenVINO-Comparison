# Comparing Audacity's OpenVINO Whisper Transcription LLMs

This repo contains all the test data, generated output and code that were used to evaluating the performance of four OpenVINO Whisper transcription models. The analysis encompasses scores achieved by each model on ten different audio tracks, along with their respective processing durations. The objective of this analysis is to provide a data-driven foundation for assessing each modelâ€™s effectiveness, examining their processing efficiency, and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
