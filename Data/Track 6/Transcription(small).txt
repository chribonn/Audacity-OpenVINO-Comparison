2.880000	13.160000	 I want to talk about beating stress today.
13.160000	17.720000	 You know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful,
17.720000	21.320000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone
21.320000	25.640000	 because we can do something about it
25.640000	27.800000	 just to cope with the stress.
27.800000	31.440000	 So maybe you have some change in your life,
31.440000	33.880000	 maybe a big change or a small change,
33.880000	36.040000	 but instead of being afraid,
36.040000	38.760000	 I think you should have a positive attitude
38.760000	42.360000	 and think of change as a normal part of life.
42.360000	45.240000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong,
45.240000	50.240000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space,
50.240000	53.600000	 so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family,
53.600000	57.760000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people
57.760000	62.200000	 is very important because then you can build strong relationships
62.200000	66.160000	 and keep commitments you have made.
66.160000	70.240000	 For example, sometimes maybe you feel you're feeling alone
70.240000	72.840000	 and you want to make some comfort,
72.840000	77.560000	 and I think you can ask the people you trust for help
77.560000	82.560000	 is very important because if you have a bunch of friends
83.440000	87.840000	 that can listen to you, then you can release some stress
87.840000	90.760000	 through talking to them.
90.760000	95.400000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing
95.400000	98.640000	 that if you want to reduce some stress,
98.640000	103.640000	 you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, that stress.
103.640000	106.760000	 How about let's begin with the S?
106.760000	111.760000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling.
111.800000	115.280000	 For example, you don't have to schedule too many things
115.280000	119.640000	 in your day, and if you feel you're too busy,
119.640000	122.280000	 you can cut out an activity or two.
122.280000	124.640000	 And how about the T word?
124.640000	128.480000	 The T word is treat your body well
128.480000	132.320000	 because experts say that exercise can reduce stress,
132.320000	136.040000	 and also if you eat healthy food,
136.040000	141.040000	 then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need.
141.040000	145.080000	 And the word is R, the extra is R.
145.080000	148.600000	 R is very important, it's say relax.
148.600000	153.840000	 You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you.
153.840000	158.040000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby
158.040000	160.000000	 and spend time with your pets,
160.000000	163.080000	 or even you can visit a spa,
163.080000	165.840000	 and that could make a very good difference.
165.840000	169.600000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed,
169.600000	173.480000	 and sometimes I may just watch some movie
173.480000	175.400000	 that make me laugh a lot.
175.400000	180.080000	 And the next word is E, E is about expectations.
180.080000	184.880000	 And I think realistic about yourself
184.880000	188.720000	 is to true to yourself and others.
188.720000	193.200000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect,
193.200000	195.400000	 and don't expect others to be too,
195.400000	199.840000	 because that will release and reduce a lot of stress
199.840000	202.800000	 for you and the people around you.
202.800000	207.800000	 And the next word is S, S is stand for sleep.
207.800000	211.360000	 And I really, really love to sleep, to be honest.
211.360000	213.800000	 That's my hobby, I think.
213.800000	217.160000	 Because sleep, if you get a good light sleep,
217.160000	220.640000	 then it will keep your mind and your body in shape.
220.640000	226.200000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours,
226.200000	227.520000	 you will actually get tired.
227.520000	231.080000	 So don't sleep too much in the day,
231.080000	233.480000	 just sleep it when you feel enough.
233.480000	237.640000	 And the last word is S again.
237.640000	239.360000	 I always do this action.
239.360000	241.520000	 The S word is smile.
241.520000	244.360000	 If you smile and have confidence,
244.360000	246.800000	 your attitude and your thoughts influence
246.800000	248.680000	 the way you see things.
248.680000	251.320000	 And if you're a negative person,
251.320000	254.800000	 you can actually learn to think in a more positive way,
254.800000	258.240000	 because that makes you feel more comfortable
258.240000	260.520000	 when you are coping with the stress.
260.520000	263.000000	 Finally, I think we should take action
263.000000	266.360000	 and apply these tips to your life,
266.360000	268.440000	 so everyone can be stressed.
