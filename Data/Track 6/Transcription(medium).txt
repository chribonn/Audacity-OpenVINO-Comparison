2.880000	13.280000	 I want to talk about feeling stress today.
13.280000	17.760000	 You know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful,
17.760000	21.360000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone
21.360000	25.720000	 because we can do something about it
25.720000	27.800000	 just to cope with the stress.
27.800000	31.440000	 So maybe you have some change in your life,
31.440000	33.880000	 maybe big change or small change,
33.880000	36.000000	 but instead of being afraid,
36.000000	38.760000	 I think you should have a positive attitude
38.760000	42.360000	 and think of change as a normal part of life.
42.360000	45.260000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong,
45.260000	50.260000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space,
50.260000	53.640000	 so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family,
53.640000	57.740000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people
57.740000	60.480000	 is very important because then you can build
60.480000	65.480000	 strong relationships and keep commitments you have made.
65.480000	70.200000	 For example, sometimes maybe you're feeling alone
70.200000	72.840000	 and you want to make some comfort,
72.840000	77.520000	 and I think you can ask the people you trust for help
77.520000	82.520000	 is very important because if you have a bunch of friends,
83.400000	87.840000	 they can listen to you, then you can release some stress
87.840000	90.720000	 through talking to them.
90.720000	95.360000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing
95.360000	98.600000	 that if you want to reduce some stress,
98.600000	103.600000	 you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, less stress.
103.600000	106.720000	 How about let's begin with the S?
106.720000	110.920000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling.
111.760000	114.240000	 For example, you don't have to schedule
114.240000	116.680000	 too many things in your day,
116.680000	119.600000	 and if you feel you're too busy,
119.600000	122.220000	 you can cut out an activity or two.
122.220000	124.600000	 And how about the T-word?
124.600000	128.440000	 The T-word is treat your body well,
128.440000	132.280000	 because experts say that exercise can reduce stress,
132.280000	136.000000	 and also if you eat healthy food,
136.000000	141.000000	 then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need.
141.000000	145.080000	 And the word is R, the next word is R.
145.080000	148.580000	 R is very important, it's say relax.
148.580000	153.760000	 You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you.
153.760000	157.960000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby
157.960000	160.000000	 and spend time with your pet,
160.000000	163.060000	 or even you can visiting a spa,
163.060000	165.840000	 and that could make a very good difference.
165.840000	169.600000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed,
169.600000	173.480000	 and sometimes I may just watch some movie
173.480000	175.400000	 that make me laughs a lot.
175.400000	180.080000	 And the next word is E, E is about expectations.
180.080000	184.840000	 And I think be realistic about yourself,
184.840000	188.700000	 is to true to yourself and others.
188.700000	193.180000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect,
193.180000	195.400000	 and don't expect others to be too,
195.400000	199.880000	 because that will release and reduce a lot of stress
199.880000	202.840000	 for you and the people around you.
202.840000	207.800000	 And the next word is S, S is stand for sleep.
207.800000	211.360000	 And I really, really love to sleep, to be honest.
211.360000	213.800000	 That's my hobby, I think.
213.800000	217.160000	 Because sleep, if you get a good light sleep,
217.160000	220.640000	 then it will keep your mind and your body in shape.
220.640000	225.640000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours,
225.640000	227.560000	 you will actually get tired.
227.560000	231.060000	 So don't sleep too much in the day,
231.060000	233.480000	 just sleep it when you feel enough.
233.480000	235.920000	 And the last word is S again.
235.920000	241.520000	 I always do this action, the S word is smile.
241.520000	244.360000	 If you smile and have confidence,
244.360000	246.800000	 your attitude and your thoughts influence
246.800000	248.700000	 the way you see things.
248.700000	251.360000	 And if you're a negative person,
251.360000	254.840000	 you can actually learn to think in a more positive way,
254.840000	258.280000	 because that makes you feel more comfortable
258.280000	260.520000	 when you are coping with the stress.
260.520000	263.040000	 Finally, I think we should take action
263.040000	266.380000	 and apply these tips to your life,
266.380000	269.040000	 so everyone can be stressed.
