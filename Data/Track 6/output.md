|    1 |0.120000	2.640000	 This recording is from the British Council. |
|    2 |2.640000	13.020000	 I want to talk about beating stress today. |
|    3 |13.020000	17.500000	 Um, you know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful, |
|    4 |17.500000	21.260000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone |
|    5 |21.260000	27.020000	 because, um, we can do something about it just to cope with the stress. |
|    6 |27.600000	31.300000	 So, um, maybe you have some change in your life, |
|    7 |31.300000	33.440000	 maybe a big change or small change, |
|    8 |33.440000	35.720000	 but instead of being afraid, |
|    9 |35.720000	38.580000	 I think you should have a positive attitude |
|   10 |38.580000	41.400000	 and think of change as a normal part of life. |
|   11 |41.400000	45.140000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong, |
|   12 |45.140000	50.020000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space, |
|   13 |50.020000	53.340000	 so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family |
|   14 |53.340000	57.580000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   15 |57.580000	61.640000	 is very important because then you can build strong relationships |
|   16 |61.640000	65.540000	 and keep commitments you have made. |
|   17 |65.540000	69.680000	 For example, sometimes maybe you're feel, you're feeling alone |
|   18 |69.680000	72.220000	 and you want to make some comfort. |
|   19 |72.220000	77.480000	 And I think, um, you can ask the people you trust for help |
|   20 |77.480000	82.940000	 is very important because, um, if you have a bunch of friends, |
|   21 |82.940000	84.620000	 they can listen to you, |
|   22 |84.620000	86.980000	 then you can release some stress |
|   23 |87.560000	89.820000	 through talking to them. |
|   24 |89.820000	95.320000	 And do you know that actually I find a very, um, funny thing |
|   25 |95.320000	98.340000	 that if you want to reduce some stress, |
|   26 |98.340000	102.480000	 you can reduce it by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, |
|   27 |102.480000	103.440000	 that's stress? |
|   28 |103.440000	106.200000	 Um, how about let's begin with the S. |
|   29 |106.200000	110.620000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling. |
|   30 |110.620000	116.020000	 Um, for example, um, you don't have to schedule too many things in your day. |
|   31 |116.020000	118.580000	 And if you feel you're too busy, |
|   32 |118.580000	121.680000	 um, you can cut out an activity or two. |
|   33 |121.680000	124.160000	 And how about the T word? |
|   34 |124.160000	127.760000	 The T word is treat your body well. |
|   35 |127.760000	132.120000	 Because experts say that exercise can reduce stress. |
|   36 |132.120000	135.180000	 And also, um, if you eat healthy food, |
|   37 |135.180000	140.020000	 then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need. |
|   38 |140.020000	143.540000	 And the word is R. |
|   39 |143.540000	144.720000	 The next word is R. |
|   40 |144.720000	146.840000	 R is very important. |
|   41 |146.840000	147.520000	 It says, relax. |
|   42 |147.520000	153.580000	 Um, you can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. |
|   43 |153.580000	157.580000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby |
|   44 |157.580000	159.820000	 and spend time with your pets. |
|   45 |159.820000	162.340000	 Or even you can visiting a spa. |
|   46 |162.340000	165.680000	 And that could make a very good difference. |
|   47 |165.680000	169.460000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed. |
|   48 |169.460000	174.700000	 And sometimes I may just watch some movie that make me laugh a lot. |
|   49 |174.700000	177.020000	 And the next word is E. |
|   50 |177.500000	179.160000	 E is about expectations. |
|   51 |179.160000	188.220000	 And I think be realistic about yourself is too true to yourself and others. |
|   52 |188.220000	192.640000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect. |
|   53 |192.640000	195.300000	 And don't expect others to be too. |
|   54 |195.300000	202.080000	 Because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you and the people around you. |
|   55 |202.080000	205.180000	 And the next word is S. |
|   56 |205.180000	207.100000	 S is stand for sleep. |
|   57 |207.480000	211.020000	 And I really, really love to sleep, to be honest. |
|   58 |211.020000	212.860000	 That's my hobby, I think. |
|   59 |212.860000	219.760000	 Because if you get a good night's sleep, then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. |
|   60 |219.760000	227.440000	 And, um, experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, you will actually get tired. |
|   61 |227.440000	230.620000	 So don't sleep too much in, ah, in a the day. |
|   62 |230.620000	233.120000	 Just sleep when you feel enough. |
|   63 |233.120000	235.620000	 And the last word is S again. |
|   64 |237.460000	239.000000	 I always do this action. |
|   65 |239.000000	240.700000	 The S word is smile. |
|   66 |240.700000	248.160000	 If you smile and have confidence, your attitude and your thoughts influence the way you see things. |
|   67 |248.160000	254.800000	 And if you're a negative person, you can actually learn to think in a more positive way. |
|   68 |254.800000	260.220000	 Because that makes you feel more comfortable when you are coping with the stress. |
|   69 |260.220000	265.900000	 Finally, I think we should take action and apply these tips to your life. |
|   70 |265.900000	268.220000	 So everyone can be stress. |
|   71 |268.220000	277.580000	 This recording is from the British Council. |

|    2 |2.880000	13.280000	 I want to talk about beating stress today. |
|    3 |13.280000	17.760000	 Life here in Hong Kong is very stressful, |
|    4 |17.760000	21.360000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone |
|    5 |21.360000	25.720000	 because we can do something about it |
|    6 |25.720000	27.800000	 just to cope with the stress. |
|    7 |27.800000	31.440000	 So maybe you have some change in your life, |
|    8 |31.440000	33.880000	 maybe big change or small change, |
|    9 |33.880000	36.000000	 but instead of being afraid, |
|   10 |36.000000	38.760000	 I think you should have a positive attitude |
|   11 |38.760000	42.360000	 and think of change as a normal part of life. |
|   12 |42.360000	45.240000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong, |
|   13 |45.240000	50.240000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space. |
|   14 |50.240000	53.600000	 So maybe you will sometimes argue with your family |
|   15 |53.600000	57.760000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   16 |57.760000	62.160000	 is very important because then you can build strong relationships |
|   17 |62.160000	66.120000	 and keep commitments you have made. |
|   18 |66.120000	70.200000	 For example, sometimes maybe you feel you're feeling alone |

|   24 |90.720000	95.360000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing |
|   25 |95.360000	98.600000	 that if you want to reduce some stress, |
|   26 |98.600000	103.600000	 you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S S stress. |
|   27 |103.600000	106.720000	 How about let's begin with the S? |
|   28 |106.720000	111.000000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling. |
|   29 |111.760000	115.280000	 For example, you don't have to schedule too many things |
|   30 |115.280000	119.640000	 in your day and if you feel you're too busy, |
|   31 |119.640000	122.240000	 you can cut L and activity or two. |
|   32 |122.240000	124.640000	 And how about the T word? |
|   33 |124.640000	128.480000	 The T word is treat your body well |
|   34 |128.480000	132.320000	 because experts say that exercise can reduce stress |
|   35 |132.320000	136.040000	 and also if you eat healthy food, |
|   36 |136.040000	141.040000	 then your brain and your body get the nutrients they lead. |
|   37 |141.040000	145.080000	 And the word is R, the next word is R. |
|   38 |145.080000	148.640000	 R is very important, is say relax. |

|   42 |163.080000	165.880000	 and that could make a very good difference. |
|   43 |165.880000	169.640000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed |
|   44 |169.640000	173.480000	 and sometimes I may just watch some movie |
|   45 |173.480000	175.440000	 that makes me laugh a lot. |
|   46 |175.440000	180.120000	 And the next word is E, E is about expectations. |
|   47 |180.120000	184.880000	 And I think the realistic about yourself |
|   48 |184.880000	188.720000	 is to true to yourself and others. |
|   49 |188.720000	193.200000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect |
|   50 |193.200000	195.400000	 and don't expect others to be too |
|   51 |195.400000	200.800000	 because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you |
|   52 |200.800000	202.800000	 and the people around you. |
|   53 |202.800000	207.800000	 And the next word is S, S is stemful sleep. |
|   54 |207.800000	211.360000	 And I really, really love to sleep to be honest. |
|   55 |211.360000	213.800000	 That's my hobby, I think. |
|   56 |213.800000	217.160000	 Because if you get a good life sleep, |
|   57 |217.160000	220.640000	 then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. |
|   58 |220.640000	226.240000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, |
|   59 |226.240000	227.560000	 you will actually get tired. |
|   60 |227.560000	231.080000	 So don't sleep too much in the day. |
|   61 |231.080000	233.520000	 Just sleep when you feel enough. |
|   62 |233.520000	235.960000	 And the last word is S again. |
|   63 |235.960000	239.400000	 I always do this action. |
|   64 |239.400000	241.560000	 The S word is smile. |
|   65 |241.560000	244.400000	 If you smile and have confidence, |
|   66 |244.400000	246.840000	 your attitude and your false influence, |
|   67 |246.840000	248.720000	 the way you see things. |
|   68 |248.720000	251.360000	 And if you're a negative person, |
|   69 |251.360000	254.840000	 you can actually learn to think in a more positive way |
|   70 |254.840000	258.280000	 because that makes you feel more comfortable |
|   71 |258.280000	260.560000	 when you are coping with the stress. |

|    1 |this recording is from the british council. i want to talk about beating stress today. life here in hong kong is very stressful, so i think today's topic is very useful for everyone because we can do something about it just to cope with the stress. so maybe you have some change in your life, maybe big change or small change, but instead of being afraid, i think you should have a positive attitude and think of change as a normal part of life. and i think maybe here in hong kong, the family are crafted into a very small housing space. so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family and i think try to resolve the disagreement with people is very important because then you can build strong relationships and keep commitments you have made. for example, sometimes maybe you feel you're feeling alone and you want to make some comfort. and i think you can ask the people you trust for help is very important because if you have a bunch of friends they can listen to you, then you can release some stress through talking to them. and do you know that actually i find a very funny thing that if you want to reduce some stress, you can reduce this by the word s-t-r-e-s s stress. how about let's begin with the s? well, i think s is that you can have the scheduling. for example, you don't have to schedule too many things in your day and if you feel you're too busy, you can cut l and activity or two. and how about the t word? the t word is treat your body well because experts say that exercise can reduce stress and also if you eat healthy food, then your brain and your body get the nutrients they lead. and the word is r, the next word is r. r is very important, is say relax. you can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby and spend time with your pets or even you can visit a spa and that could make a very good difference. and for me, i like to play piano when i feel stressed and sometimes i may just watch some movie that makes me laugh a lot. and the next word is e, e is about expectations. and i think the realistic about yourself is to true to yourself and others. so you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect and don't expect others to be too because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you and the people around you. and the next word is s, s is stemful sleep. and i really, really love to sleep to be honest. that's my hobby, i think. because if you get a good life sleep, then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. and experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, you will actually get tired. so don't sleep too much in the day. just sleep when you feel enough. and the last word is s again. i always do this action. the s word is smile. if you smile and have confidence, your attitude and your false influence, the way you see things. and if you're a negative person, you can actually learn to think in a more positive way because that makes you feel more comfortable when you are coping with the stress. finally, i think we should take action and apply these tips to your life so everyone can be stressed. this recording is from the british council to find more activities to practice your english. visit www.britishcouncil.org/learnenglish. learn english.

|    1 |0.560000	2.880000	 This recording is from the British Council. |
|    2 |2.880000	13.160000	 I want to talk about beating stress today. |
|    3 |13.160000	17.720000	 You know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful, |
|    4 |17.720000	21.320000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone |
|    5 |21.320000	25.640000	 because we can do something about it |
|    6 |25.640000	27.800000	 just to cope with the stress. |
|    7 |27.800000	31.440000	 So maybe you have some change in your life, |
|    8 |31.440000	33.880000	 maybe a big change or a small change, |
|    9 |33.880000	36.040000	 but instead of being afraid, |
|   10 |36.040000	38.760000	 I think you should have a positive attitude |
|   11 |38.760000	42.360000	 and think of change as a normal part of life. |
|   12 |42.360000	45.240000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong, |
|   13 |45.240000	50.240000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space, |
|   14 |50.240000	53.600000	 so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family, |
|   15 |53.600000	57.760000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   16 |57.760000	62.200000	 is very important because then you can build strong relationships |
|   17 |62.200000	66.160000	 and keep commitments you have made. |
|   18 |66.160000	70.240000	 For example, sometimes maybe you feel you're feeling alone |
|   19 |70.240000	72.840000	 and you want to make some comfort, |
|   20 |72.840000	77.560000	 and I think you can ask the people you trust for help |
|   21 |77.560000	82.560000	 is very important because if you have a bunch of friends |
|   22 |83.440000	87.840000	 that can listen to you, then you can release some stress |
|   23 |87.840000	90.760000	 through talking to them. |
|   24 |90.760000	95.400000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing |
|   25 |95.400000	98.640000	 that if you want to reduce some stress, |
|   26 |98.640000	103.640000	 you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, that stress. |
|   27 |103.640000	106.760000	 How about let's begin with the S? |
|   28 |106.760000	111.760000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling. |
|   29 |111.800000	115.280000	 For example, you don't have to schedule too many things |
|   30 |115.280000	119.640000	 in your day, and if you feel you're too busy, |
|   31 |119.640000	122.280000	 you can cut out an activity or two. |
|   32 |122.280000	124.640000	 And how about the T word? |
|   33 |124.640000	128.480000	 The T word is treat your body well |
|   34 |128.480000	132.320000	 because experts say that exercise can reduce stress, |
|   35 |132.320000	136.040000	 and also if you eat healthy food, |
|   36 |136.040000	141.040000	 then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need. |
|   37 |141.040000	145.080000	 And the word is R, the extra is R. |
|   38 |145.080000	148.600000	 R is very important, it's say relax. |
|   39 |148.600000	153.840000	 You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. |
|   40 |153.840000	158.040000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby |
|   41 |158.040000	160.000000	 and spend time with your pets, |
|   42 |160.000000	163.080000	 or even you can visit a spa, |
|   43 |163.080000	165.840000	 and that could make a very good difference. |
|   44 |165.840000	169.600000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed, |
|   45 |169.600000	173.480000	 and sometimes I may just watch some movie |
|   46 |173.480000	175.400000	 that make me laugh a lot. |
|   47 |175.400000	180.080000	 And the next word is E, E is about expectations. |
|   48 |180.080000	184.880000	 And I think realistic about yourself |
|   49 |184.880000	188.720000	 is to true to yourself and others. |
|   50 |188.720000	193.200000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect, |
|   51 |193.200000	195.400000	 and don't expect others to be too, |
|   52 |195.400000	199.840000	 because that will release and reduce a lot of stress |
|   53 |199.840000	202.800000	 for you and the people around you. |
|   54 |202.800000	207.800000	 And the next word is S, S is stand for sleep. |
|   55 |207.800000	211.360000	 And I really, really love to sleep, to be honest. |
|   56 |211.360000	213.800000	 That's my hobby, I think. |
|   57 |213.800000	217.160000	 Because sleep, if you get a good light sleep, |
|   58 |217.160000	220.640000	 then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. |
|   59 |220.640000	226.200000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, |
|   60 |226.200000	227.520000	 you will actually get tired. |
|   61 |227.520000	231.080000	 So don't sleep too much in the day, |
|   62 |231.080000	233.480000	 just sleep it when you feel enough. |
|   63 |233.480000	237.640000	 And the last word is S again. |
|   64 |237.640000	239.360000	 I always do this action. |
|   65 |239.360000	241.520000	 The S word is smile. |
|   66 |241.520000	244.360000	 If you smile and have confidence, |
|   67 |244.360000	246.800000	 your attitude and your thoughts influence |
|   68 |246.800000	248.680000	 the way you see things. |
|   69 |248.680000	251.320000	 And if you're a negative person, |
|   70 |251.320000	254.800000	 you can actually learn to think in a more positive way, |
|   71 |254.800000	258.240000	 because that makes you feel more comfortable |
|   72 |258.240000	260.520000	 when you are coping with the stress. |
|   73 |260.520000	263.000000	 Finally, I think we should take action |
|   74 |263.000000	266.360000	 and apply these tips to your life, |
|   75 |266.360000	268.440000	 so everyone can be stressed. |

|    1 |0.560000	2.880000	 This recording is from the British Council. |
|    2 |2.880000	13.280000	 I want to talk about feeling stress today. |
|    3 |13.280000	17.760000	 You know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful, |
|    4 |17.760000	21.360000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone |
|    5 |21.360000	25.720000	 because we can do something about it |
|    6 |25.720000	27.800000	 just to cope with the stress. |
|    7 |27.800000	31.440000	 So maybe you have some change in your life, |
|    8 |31.440000	33.880000	 maybe big change or small change, |
|    9 |33.880000	36.000000	 but instead of being afraid, |
|   10 |36.000000	38.760000	 I think you should have a positive attitude |
|   11 |38.760000	42.360000	 and think of change as a normal part of life. |
|   12 |42.360000	45.260000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong, |
|   13 |45.260000	50.260000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space, |
|   14 |50.260000	53.640000	 so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family, |
|   15 |53.640000	57.740000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   16 |57.740000	60.480000	 is very important because then you can build |
|   17 |60.480000	65.480000	 strong relationships and keep commitments you have made. |
|   18 |65.480000	70.200000	 For example, sometimes maybe you're feeling alone |
|   19 |70.200000	72.840000	 and you want to make some comfort, |
|   20 |72.840000	77.520000	 and I think you can ask the people you trust for help |
|   21 |77.520000	82.520000	 is very important because if you have a bunch of friends, |
|   22 |83.400000	87.840000	 they can listen to you, then you can release some stress |
|   23 |87.840000	90.720000	 through talking to them. |
|   24 |90.720000	95.360000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing |
|   25 |95.360000	98.600000	 that if you want to reduce some stress, |
|   26 |98.600000	103.600000	 you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, less stress. |
|   27 |103.600000	106.720000	 How about let's begin with the S? |
|   28 |106.720000	110.920000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling. |
|   29 |111.760000	114.240000	 For example, you don't have to schedule |
|   30 |114.240000	116.680000	 too many things in your day, |
|   31 |116.680000	119.600000	 and if you feel you're too busy, |
|   32 |119.600000	122.220000	 you can cut out an activity or two. |
|   33 |122.220000	124.600000	 And how about the T-word? |
|   34 |124.600000	128.440000	 The T-word is treat your body well, |
|   35 |128.440000	132.280000	 because experts say that exercise can reduce stress, |
|   36 |132.280000	136.000000	 and also if you eat healthy food, |
|   37 |136.000000	141.000000	 then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need. |
|   38 |141.000000	145.080000	 And the word is R, the next word is R. |
|   39 |145.080000	148.580000	 R is very important, it's say relax. |
|   40 |148.580000	153.760000	 You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. |
|   41 |153.760000	157.960000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby |
|   42 |157.960000	160.000000	 and spend time with your pet, |
|   43 |160.000000	163.060000	 or even you can visiting a spa, |
|   44 |163.060000	165.840000	 and that could make a very good difference. |
|   45 |165.840000	169.600000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed, |
|   46 |169.600000	173.480000	 and sometimes I may just watch some movie |
|   47 |173.480000	175.400000	 that make me laughs a lot. |
|   48 |175.400000	180.080000	 And the next word is E, E is about expectations. |
|   49 |180.080000	184.840000	 And I think be realistic about yourself, |
|   50 |184.840000	188.700000	 is to true to yourself and others. |
|   51 |188.700000	193.180000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect, |
|   52 |193.180000	195.400000	 and don't expect others to be too, |
|   53 |195.400000	199.880000	 because that will release and reduce a lot of stress |
|   54 |199.880000	202.840000	 for you and the people around you. |
|   55 |202.840000	207.800000	 And the next word is S, S is stand for sleep. |
|   56 |207.800000	211.360000	 And I really, really love to sleep, to be honest. |
|   57 |211.360000	213.800000	 That's my hobby, I think. |
|   58 |213.800000	217.160000	 Because sleep, if you get a good light sleep, |
|   59 |217.160000	220.640000	 then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. |
|   60 |220.640000	225.640000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, |
|   61 |225.640000	227.560000	 you will actually get tired. |
|   62 |227.560000	231.060000	 So don't sleep too much in the day, |
|   63 |231.060000	233.480000	 just sleep it when you feel enough. |
|   64 |233.480000	235.920000	 And the last word is S again. |
|   65 |235.920000	241.520000	 I always do this action, the S word is smile. |
|   66 |241.520000	244.360000	 If you smile and have confidence, |
|   67 |244.360000	246.800000	 your attitude and your thoughts influence |
|   68 |246.800000	248.700000	 the way you see things. |
|   69 |248.700000	251.360000	 And if you're a negative person, |
|   70 |251.360000	254.840000	 you can actually learn to think in a more positive way, |
|   71 |254.840000	258.280000	 because that makes you feel more comfortable |
|   72 |258.280000	260.520000	 when you are coping with the stress. |
|   73 |260.520000	263.040000	 Finally, I think we should take action |
|   74 |263.040000	266.380000	 and apply these tips to your life, |
|   75 |266.380000	269.040000	 so everyone can be stressed. |

|    1 |this recording is from the british council. i want to talk about feeling stress today. you know, life here in hong kong is very stressful, so i think today's topic is very useful for everyone because we can do something about it just to cope with the stress. so maybe you have some change in your life, maybe big change or small change, but instead of being afraid, i think you should have a positive attitude and think of change as a normal part of life. and i think maybe here in hong kong, the family are crafted into a very small housing space, so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family, and i think try to resolve the disagreement with people is very important because then you can build strong relationships and keep commitments you have made. for example, sometimes maybe you're feeling alone and you want to make some comfort, and i think you can ask the people you trust for help is very important because if you have a bunch of friends, they can listen to you, then you can release some stress through talking to them. and do you know that actually i find a very funny thing that if you want to reduce some stress, you can reduce this by the word s-t-r-e-s-s, less stress. how about let's begin with the s? well, i think s is that you can have the scheduling. for example, you don't have to schedule too many things in your day, and if you feel you're too busy, you can cut out an activity or two. and how about the t-word? the t-word is treat your body well, because experts say that exercise can reduce stress, and also if you eat healthy food, then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need. and the word is r, the next word is r. r is very important, it's say relax. you can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby and spend time with your pet, or even you can visiting a spa, and that could make a very good difference. and for me, i like to play piano when i feel stressed, and sometimes i may just watch some movie that make me laughs a lot. and the next word is e, e is about expectations. and i think be realistic about yourself, is to true to yourself and others. so you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect, and don't expect others to be too, because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you and the people around you. and the next word is s, s is stand for sleep. and i really, really love to sleep, to be honest. that's my hobby, i think. because sleep, if you get a good light sleep, then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. and experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, you will actually get tired. so don't sleep too much in the day, just sleep it when you feel enough. and the last word is s again. i always do this action, the s word is smile. if you smile and have confidence, your attitude and your thoughts influence the way you see things. and if you're a negative person, you can actually learn to think in a more positive way, because that makes you feel more comfortable when you are coping with the stress. finally, i think we should take action and apply these tips to your life, so everyone can be stressed.

|    1 |0.120000	2.640000	 This recording is from the British Council. |
|    2 |2.640000	13.020000	 I want to talk about beating stress today. |
|    3 |13.020000	17.500000	 You know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful, |
|    4 |17.500000	21.260000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone |
|    5 |21.260000	27.020000	 because we can do something about it just to cope with the stress. |
|    6 |27.600000	31.300000	 So maybe you have some change in your life, |
|    7 |31.300000	33.440000	 maybe a big change or small change, |
|    8 |33.440000	35.720000	 but instead of being afraid, |
|    9 |35.720000	38.580000	 I think you should have a positive attitude |
|   10 |38.580000	41.400000	 and think of change as a normal part of life. |
|   11 |41.400000	45.140000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong, |
|   12 |45.140000	50.020000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space, |
|   13 |50.020000	53.340000	 so maybe you will sometimes argue with your family |
|   14 |53.340000	57.160000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   15 |57.160000	57.580000	 and try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   16 |57.580000	61.640000	 is very important because then you can build strong relationships |
|   17 |57.580000	57.580000	 and try to resolve the disagreement with people |
|   18 |61.640000	65.540000	 and keep commitments you have made. |
|   19 |65.540000	69.680000	 For example, sometimes maybe you're feeling alone |
|   20 |69.680000	72.220000	 and you want to make some comfort. |
|   21 |72.220000	77.480000	 And I think you can ask the people you trust for help |
|   22 |77.480000	82.940000	 is very important because if you have a bunch of friends, |
|   23 |82.940000	84.620000	 they can listen to you, |
|   24 |84.620000	86.980000	 then you can release some stress. |
|   25 |87.560000	89.820000	 And I think you can do that through talking to them. |
|   26 |89.820000	95.320000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing |
|   27 |95.320000	98.340000	 that if you want to reduce some stress, |
|   28 |98.340000	102.480000	 you can reduce it by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, |
|   29 |102.480000	103.440000	 that's stress. |
|   30 |103.440000	106.200000	 How about let's begin with the S. |
|   31 |106.200000	110.620000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling. |
|   32 |110.620000	116.020000	 For example, you don't have to schedule too many things in your day. |
|   33 |116.020000	117.540000	 And if you feel like you have a lot of things to do, |
|   34 |117.540000	118.580000	 if you feel you're too busy, |
|   35 |118.580000	121.680000	 you can cut out an activity or two. |
|   36 |121.680000	124.160000	 And how about the T word? |
|   37 |124.160000	127.760000	 The T word is treat your body well. |
|   38 |127.760000	132.120000	 Because experts say that exercise can reduce stress. |
|   39 |132.120000	135.180000	 And also, if you eat healthy food, |
|   40 |135.180000	140.020000	 then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need. |
|   41 |140.020000	143.540000	 And the word is R. |
|   42 |143.540000	144.720000	 The next word is R. |
|   43 |144.720000	146.840000	 R is very important. |
|   44 |146.840000	147.520000	 It says, |
|   45 |147.520000	153.580000	 You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. |
|   46 |153.580000	157.580000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby |
|   47 |157.580000	159.820000	 and spend time with your pets. |
|   48 |159.820000	162.340000	 Or even you can visiting a spa. |
|   49 |162.340000	165.680000	 And that could make a very good difference. |
|   50 |165.680000	169.460000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed. |
|   51 |169.460000	174.700000	 And sometimes I may just watch some movie that make me laugh a lot. |
|   52 |174.700000	177.020000	 And the next word is E. |
|   53 |177.500000	179.160000	 E is about expectations. |
|   54 |179.160000	188.220000	 And I think be realistic about yourself is too true to yourself and others. |
|   55 |188.220000	192.640000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect. |
|   56 |192.640000	195.300000	 And don't expect others to be too. |
|   57 |195.300000	202.080000	 Because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you and the people around you. |
|   58 |202.080000	205.180000	 And the next word is S. |
|   59 |205.180000	207.100000	 S is stand for sleep. |
|   60 |207.480000	211.020000	 And I really, really love to sleep, to be honest. |
|   61 |211.020000	212.860000	 That's my hobby, I think. |
|   62 |212.860000	219.760000	 Because if you get a good night's sleep, then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. |
|   63 |219.760000	227.440000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, you will actually get tired. |
|   64 |227.440000	230.620000	 So don't sleep too much in the day. |
|   65 |230.620000	233.120000	 Just sleep when you feel enough. |
|   66 |233.120000	235.620000	 And the last word is S again. |
|   67 |237.460000	239.000000	 I always do this action. |
|   68 |239.000000	240.700000	 The S word is smile. |
|   69 |240.700000	248.160000	 If you smile and have confidence, your attitude and your thoughts influence the way you see things. |
|   70 |248.160000	254.800000	 And if you're a negative person, you can actually learn to think in a more positive way. |
|   71 |254.800000	260.220000	 Because that makes you feel more comfortable when you are coping with the stress. |
|   72 |260.220000	265.900000	 Finally, I think we should take action and apply these tips to your life. |
|   73 |265.900000	267.440000	 So everyone can do it. |
|   74 |267.440000	268.220000	 There can't be stress. |
