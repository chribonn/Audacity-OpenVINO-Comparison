2.880000	13.280000	 I want to talk about beating stress today.
13.280000	17.760000	 Life here in Hong Kong is very stressful,
17.760000	21.360000	 so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone
21.360000	25.720000	 because we can do something about it
25.720000	27.800000	 just to cope with the stress.
27.800000	31.440000	 So maybe you have some change in your life,
31.440000	33.880000	 maybe big change or small change,
33.880000	36.000000	 but instead of being afraid,
36.000000	38.760000	 I think you should have a positive attitude
38.760000	42.360000	 and think of change as a normal part of life.
42.360000	45.240000	 And I think maybe here in Hong Kong,
45.240000	50.240000	 the family are crafted into a very small housing space.
50.240000	53.600000	 So maybe you will sometimes argue with your family
53.600000	57.760000	 and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people
57.760000	62.160000	 is very important because then you can build strong relationships
62.160000	66.120000	 and keep commitments you have made.
66.120000	70.200000	 For example, sometimes maybe you feel you're feeling alone
70.200000	72.800000	 and you want to make some comfort.
72.800000	77.520000	 And I think you can ask the people you trust for help
77.520000	83.400000	 is very important because if you have a bunch of friends
83.400000	87.840000	 they can listen to you, then you can release some stress
87.840000	90.720000	 through talking to them.
90.720000	95.360000	 And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing
95.360000	98.600000	 that if you want to reduce some stress,
98.600000	103.600000	 you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S S stress.
103.600000	106.720000	 How about let's begin with the S?
106.720000	111.000000	 Well, I think S is that you can have the scheduling.
111.760000	115.280000	 For example, you don't have to schedule too many things
115.280000	119.640000	 in your day and if you feel you're too busy,
119.640000	122.240000	 you can cut L and activity or two.
122.240000	124.640000	 And how about the T word?
124.640000	128.480000	 The T word is treat your body well
128.480000	132.320000	 because experts say that exercise can reduce stress
132.320000	136.040000	 and also if you eat healthy food,
136.040000	141.040000	 then your brain and your body get the nutrients they lead.
141.040000	145.080000	 And the word is R, the next word is R.
145.080000	148.640000	 R is very important, is say relax.
148.640000	153.840000	 You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you.
153.840000	158.120000	 Maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby
158.120000	163.080000	 and spend time with your pets or even you can visit a spa
163.080000	165.880000	 and that could make a very good difference.
165.880000	169.640000	 And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed
169.640000	173.480000	 and sometimes I may just watch some movie
173.480000	175.440000	 that makes me laugh a lot.
175.440000	180.120000	 And the next word is E, E is about expectations.
180.120000	184.880000	 And I think the realistic about yourself
184.880000	188.720000	 is to true to yourself and others.
188.720000	193.200000	 So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect
193.200000	195.400000	 and don't expect others to be too
195.400000	200.800000	 because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you
200.800000	202.800000	 and the people around you.
202.800000	207.800000	 And the next word is S, S is stemful sleep.
207.800000	211.360000	 And I really, really love to sleep to be honest.
211.360000	213.800000	 That's my hobby, I think.
213.800000	217.160000	 Because if you get a good life sleep,
217.160000	220.640000	 then it will keep your mind and your body in shape.
220.640000	226.240000	 And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours,
226.240000	227.560000	 you will actually get tired.
227.560000	231.080000	 So don't sleep too much in the day.
231.080000	233.520000	 Just sleep when you feel enough.
233.520000	235.960000	 And the last word is S again.
235.960000	239.400000	 I always do this action.
239.400000	241.560000	 The S word is smile.
241.560000	244.400000	 If you smile and have confidence,
244.400000	246.840000	 your attitude and your false influence,
246.840000	248.720000	 the way you see things.
248.720000	251.360000	 And if you're a negative person,
251.360000	254.840000	 you can actually learn to think in a more positive way
254.840000	258.280000	 because that makes you feel more comfortable
258.280000	260.560000	 when you are coping with the stress.
260.560000	263.040000	 Finally, I think we should take action
263.040000	268.040000	 and apply these tips to your life so everyone can be stressed.
