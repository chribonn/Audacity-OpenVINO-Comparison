|    1 |0.000000	8.800000	 Yo, Leo.  Great to back with you again for Episode 790 Wow our last episode of October 2020. |
|    2 |8.800000	9.460000	 Wow. |
|    3 |9.460000	17.580000	 And those who are watching the video will notice that I'm, eh, I'm coming to everyone from our alternate location. |
|    4 |17.580000	29.680000	 Em, I gotta, I was working on the podcast, like a couple hours to go, and all of my connectivity disappeared. |
|    5 |29.680000	39.100000	 Em, later, when I got over here, I logged onto Cox, which is my cable modem provider, and I, I got a kick out of their notice. |
|    6 |39.100000	46.080000	 They said:  "We've noticed - ho boy - a temporary outage related to your Internet, TV, and phone service." |
|    7 |46.080000	49.480000	 So first of all, they noticed a temporary outage? |
|    8 |49.480000	55.380000	 They, they noticed an outage which they hope is temporary.  And of course I'm hoping that, too. |
|    9 |55.380000	59.660000	 And they said the estimated time to repair, 4:13 p.m. |
|   10 |59.660000	64.520000	 So of course we record this between 1:30 and 2:00 typically. |
|   11 |64.520000	67.320000	 We're pretty much wrapping up around that time. |
|   12 |67.320000	73.640000	 So I thought, eh, I think maybe I need to set up the alternate location. |
|   13 |73.640000	75.300000	 So I did so. |
|   14 |75.300000	77.280000	 That's twice now in like a month or something; right? |
|   15 |77.280000	79.460000	 Yeah, -ho man - yeah. |
|   16 |79.460000	85.940000	 And of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the U.S., I have no alternative provider. |
|   17 |85.940000	89.040000	 You know, I mean, they're, they're nominally pretty good. |
|   18 |89.040000	89.580000	 But again, |
|   19 |89.580000	92.020000	 as you said, Leo, it's getting to be like, okay, wait a minute. |
|   20 |92.020000	95.620000	 You know, on the other hand, we did go for 15 years without any trouble, |
|   21 |95.620000	98.920000	 although remember the old days with two T1s?  |
|   22 |98.920000	100.260000	 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. |
|   23 |100.260000	102.960000	 Those were the days. |
|   24 |102.960000	108.200000	 Two T1s that gave you a fraction of the speed you're getting with a single cable connection. |
|   25 |108.200000	108.580000	 Yes, |
|   26 |108.580000	109.680000	 exactly, |
|   27 |109.680000	110.640000	 exactly. |
|   28 |110.640000	113.800000	 The only thing it really had going for it was it had a lot of reliability. Reliable. |
|   29 |113.800000	117.340000	 Because, yeah, back then it was twisted pair, |
|   30 |117.340000	119.260000	 and they were so expensive |
|   31 |119.260000	122.940000	 that it was a high priority to keep them up and running. |
|   32 |122.940000	125.800000	 Yeah, 1.44 megabits. |
|   33 |125.800000	126.920000	 Uh-huh. |
|   34 |126.920000	127.860000	 Ridiculous. |
|   35 |127.860000	129.260000	 Why did we think that was a lot? |
|   36 |129.260000	130.360000	 Yeah. |
|   37 |130.360000	135.360000	 And I remember, too, when I initially, was like back in the day when I was getting it, |
|   38 |135.360000	137.280000	 I would mention that to people. |
|   39 |137.280000	139.420000	 And this is when of course people had dial-up, |
|   40 |139.420000	143.060000	 and they were like, you have a T1? |
|   41 |143.060000	144.120000	 Oh. |
|   42 |144.120000	145.980000	 It's like, okay, |
|   43 |145.980000	146.860000	 yeah, |
|   44 |146.860000	148.980000	 yeah. |
|   45 |148.980000	150.440000	 But fortunately technology moves on. |
|   46 |150.440000	152.460000	 We've got a bunch of stuff, |
|   47 |152.460000	160.140000	 speaking of technology moving on, to talk about.  There's a recently patched zero-day which, eh |
|   48 |160.140000	164.520000	 hit Chrome, only the third in a year. |
|   49 |164.520000	166.600000	 Fortunately Chrome doesn't have many. |
|   50 |166.600000	170.620000	 But when it does, they tend to be significant because of course, as we know, it's the majority |
|   51 |170.620000	172.180000	 browser now on the Internet. |
|   52 |172.180000	177.400000	 There's also a nice new feature that Chrome is offering we'll talk about. |
|   53 |177.400000	178.960000	 We're going to take a look at site isolation, |
|   54 |178.960000	182.160000	 which is coming soon to Firefox, |
|   55 |182.160000	189.620000	 and Microsoft's announcement of Edge for Linux, which, okay, we'll talk about that. |
|   56 |189.620000	196.960000	 We've got some movement in the further deprecation of IE, of course, Internet Explorer; and a |
|   57 |196.960000	206.260000	 potentially massive SQL injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million |
|   58 |206.260000	206.960000	 WordPress sites. |
|   59 |206.960000	208.320000	 So here again, |
|   60 |208.560000	210.460000	 WordPress, we just keep talking about this. |
|   61 |210.460000	218.060000	 And, and as everyone knows, I, I shut down mine because it's like, no.  I'm just crazy to do that. |
|   62 |218.060000	227.500000	 Em, and despite the fact that this was automatically remediated, some admins of their own sites |
|   63 |227.500000	230.800000	 complained about the fact that they were just saved. |
|   64 |230.800000	232.860000	 Anyway, we'll talk about that. |
|   65 |232.860000	238.460000	 We've got some miscellany, a bit of closing-the-loop feedback, and an update on where I stand with |
|   66 |238.460000	238.920000	 SpinRite. |
|   67 |238.920000	247.380000	 And then we're going to end by looking at the NSA's recently published list of the top 25 network |
|   68 |247.380000	256.580000	 vulnerabilities currently in use by malicious Chinese state actors - ho wow - to attack assets in the U.S. |

|   13 |56.200000	63.800000	 It's an estimated time to repair for 13 p.m., so of course, we record this between 1.30 |
|   14 |63.800000	64.800000	 and 2. |
|   15 |64.800000	69.760000	 Typically, we're pretty much wrapping up around that time, so I thought, "I think maybe I need |
|   16 |69.760000	73.920000	 to set up the alternate location." |
|   17 |73.920000	74.920000	 So I did say something. |
|   18 |74.920000	77.680000	 - That's about now in like a month or something, right? |
|   19 |77.680000	78.680000	 - Yeah. |
|   20 |78.680000	79.680000	 - Oh, man. |
|   21 |79.680000	85.440000	 - Yeah, and of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the U.S., I have no alternative |
|   22 |85.440000	86.440000	 provider. |
|   23 |86.440000	90.760000	 You know, I mean, they're nominally pretty good, but again, as you said, Leo, it's getting |
|   24 |90.760000	92.200000	 to be like, "Okay, wait a minute." |
|   25 |92.200000	97.080000	 You know, on the other hand, we did go for 15 years without any trouble, although remember |
|   26 |97.080000	98.840000	 the old days with two T-1s? |
|   27 |98.840000	100.440000	 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. |
|   28 |100.440000	102.400000	 - Those were the days. |
|   29 |102.400000	103.400000	 Anyway, two T-1s. |
|   30 |103.400000	108.320000	 - Two T-1s, it gave you a fraction of the speed you're getting with a single cable. |
|   31 |108.320000	109.320000	 - Yes. |
|   32 |109.320000	110.320000	 Exactly. |
|   33 |110.320000	111.320000	 Exactly. |
|   34 |111.320000	113.800000	 The only thing I really had going for it was I had a lot of reliability. |
|   35 |113.800000	114.800000	 - Liability, that's right. |
|   36 |114.800000	120.840000	 - Yeah, back then, it was, you know, a twisted pair, and they were so expensive that it was |
|   37 |120.840000	123.800000	 a high priority to keep them up and running. |
|   38 |123.800000	124.800000	 - 1.44 megabits. |
|   39 |124.800000	125.800000	 - Uh-huh. |
|   40 |125.800000	126.800000	 - Ridiculous. |
|   41 |126.800000	129.800000	 Why do we think that was a lot? |
|   42 |129.800000	130.800000	 - Yeah. |
|   43 |130.800000	136.320000	 And I remember, too, when I initially was like back in the day when I was getting it, I would |
|   44 |136.320000	137.320000	 like mention that to people. |
|   45 |137.320000	145.200000	 Well, this is when, of course, people had dial-up, and they were like, "You have a T-1?" |
|   46 |145.200000	150.480000	 That's like, "Okay, yeah, yeah, unfortunately, technology moves on." |
|   47 |150.480000	155.920000	 We've got a bunch of stuff, speaking of technology moving on to talk about. |
|   48 |155.920000	164.760000	 There's a recently patched zero-day, which hit Chrome only the third in a year. |
|   49 |164.760000	169.000000	 Fortunately, Chrome doesn't have many, but when it does, they tend to be significant |
|   50 |169.000000	173.760000	 because, of course, as we know, it's the majority browser now on the Internet. |
|   51 |173.760000	178.000000	 There's also a nice new feature that Chrome is offering we'll talk about. |
|   52 |178.000000	183.560000	 We're going to take a look at site isolation, which is coming soon to Firefox, and Microsoft's |
|   53 |183.560000	190.240000	 announcement of Edge for Linux, which, yeah, okay, we'll talk about that. |
|   54 |190.240000	197.360000	 You've got some movement in the further decoration of IE, of course, Internet Explorer, and a |
|   55 |197.360000	206.480000	 potentially massive SQL injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million |
|   56 |206.480000	207.480000	 WordPress sites. |
|   57 |207.480000	214.000000	 So, here again, WordPress, we just keep talking about this, and as everyone knows, I shut |
|   58 |214.000000	219.800000	 down mine because it's like, "No, I'm just this crazy to do that." |
|   59 |219.800000	227.520000	 And despite the fact that this was automatically remediated, some admins of their own sites |
|   60 |227.520000	230.720000	 complained about the fact that they were just saved. |
|   61 |230.720000	233.280000	 Anyway, we'll talk about that. |
|   62 |233.280000	237.760000	 We've got some miscellaneous, a bit of closing the loop feedback, and an update on where |
|   63 |237.760000	243.120000	 I stand with the spin-right, and then we're going to end by looking at the NSA's recently |
|   64 |243.120000	253.320000	 published list of the top 25 network vulnerabilities currently in use by malicious Chinese state |
|   65 |253.320000	256.600000	 actors to attack assets in the U.S. |

|    1 |0.000000	5.000000	 - Yo Leo, great to be back with you again for episode 790. |
|    2 |5.000000	6.760000	 - Wow. |
|    3 |6.760000	9.160000	 - Our last episode of October, 2020. |
|    4 |9.160000	10.120000	 - Wow. |
|    5 |10.120000	13.320000	 - And those who are watching the video will notice |
|    6 |13.320000	17.960000	 that I'm coming to everyone from our alternate location. |
|    7 |17.960000	24.840000	 I was working on the podcast like a couple hours to go |
|    8 |26.820000	30.040000	 and all of my connectivity disappeared. |
|    9 |30.040000	34.960000	 Later, when I got over here, I logged on to Cox, |
|   10 |34.960000	37.280000	 which is my cable motor provider, |
|   11 |37.280000	39.240000	 and I got a kick out of their notice. |
|   12 |39.240000	43.640000	 They said, we've noticed a temporary outage |
|   13 |43.640000	46.200000	 related to your internet, TV, and phone service. |
|   14 |46.200000	49.560000	 So first of all, they noticed a temporary outage. |
|   15 |49.560000	53.320000	 They noticed an outage, which they hope is temporary. |
|   16 |53.320000	55.720000	 And of course, I'm hoping that too. |
|   17 |55.720000	60.720000	 And they said the estimated time to repair for 13 p.m. |
|   18 |60.720000	65.120000	 So of course, we record this between 1.30 and 2.00 typically. |
|   19 |65.120000	67.440000	 We're pretty much wrapping up around that time. |
|   20 |67.440000	70.940000	 So I thought, I think maybe I need to, you know, |
|   21 |70.940000	73.840000	 set up the alternate location. |
|   22 |73.840000	75.680000	 So I did find something. |
|   23 |75.680000	77.480000	 - Now in like a month or something, right? |
|   24 |77.480000	79.600000	 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. |
|   25 |79.600000	84.120000	 And of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the US, |
|   26 |84.120000	86.720000	 I have no alternative provider. |
|   27 |86.720000	89.120000	 You know, I mean, they're nominally pretty good. |
|   28 |89.120000	90.400000	 But again, as you said, Leo, |
|   29 |90.400000	92.280000	 it's getting to be like, okay, wait a minute. |
|   30 |92.280000	93.400000	 You know, on the other hand, |
|   31 |93.400000	95.720000	 we did go for 15 years without any trouble. |
|   32 |95.720000	99.020000	 Although, remember the old days with two T1s? |
|   33 |99.020000	100.960000	 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. |
|   34 |100.960000	102.680000	 - Those were the days. |
|   35 |102.680000	104.040000	 Anyway, two T1s. |
|   36 |104.040000	106.440000	 - The T1s, they gave you a fraction of the speed |
|   37 |106.440000	108.280000	 again with a single cable. |
|   38 |108.280000	111.240000	 - Yes, exactly, exactly. |
|   39 |111.240000	112.720000	 The only thing I really had going for it |
|   40 |112.720000	114.200000	 was I had a lot of reliability. |
|   41 |114.200000	116.600000	 So because, yeah, back then it was, you know, |
|   42 |116.600000	120.160000	 a twisted pair and they were so expensive |
|   43 |120.160000	123.640000	 that it was a high priority to keep them up and running. |
|   44 |123.640000	126.500000	 - 1.44 megabits. |
|   45 |126.500000	127.340000	 - Uh-huh. |
|   46 |127.340000	130.040000	 - Ridiculous, why did we think that was a lot? |
|   47 |130.040000	131.000000	 - Yeah. |
|   48 |131.000000	134.000000	 And I remember too, when I initially was like, |
|   49 |134.000000	135.680000	 back in the day when I was getting it, |
|   50 |135.680000	137.360000	 I would like mention that to people. |
|   51 |137.360000	139.720000	 This is when of course people had dial-up |
|   52 |139.720000	143.620000	 and they were like, "You have a T1?" |
|   53 |143.620000	148.540000	 Oh, it's like, okay, yeah, yeah. |
|   54 |148.540000	150.700000	 Fortunately, technology moves on. |
|   55 |150.700000	154.480000	 We got a bunch of stuff speaking of technology moving on |
|   56 |154.480000	155.580000	 to talk about. |
|   57 |155.580000	159.820000	 There's a recently patched Zero Day, |
|   58 |159.820000	164.820000	 which hit Chrome only the third in a year. |
|   59 |164.820000	166.680000	 Fortunately, Chrome doesn't have many, |
|   60 |166.680000	169.040000	 but when it does, they tend to be significant |
|   61 |169.040000	169.920000	 because of course, as we know, |
|   62 |169.920000	172.560000	 it's the majority browser now on the internet. |
|   63 |172.560000	175.680000	 There's also a nice new feature |
|   64 |175.680000	177.880000	 that Chrome is offering we'll talk about. |
|   65 |177.880000	180.240000	 We're going to take a look at Site Isolation, |
|   66 |180.240000	182.640000	 which is coming soon to Firefox, |
|   67 |182.640000	186.440000	 and Microsoft's announcement of Edge for Linux, |
|   68 |186.440000	190.160000	 which, okay, we'll talk about that. |
|   69 |190.160000	194.400000	 We've got some movement in the further decrecation of IE, |
|   70 |194.400000	196.140000	 of course, Internet Explorer, |
|   71 |196.140000	201.140000	 and a potentially massive SQL injection attack |
|   72 |201.140000	204.200000	 that was recently dodged |
|   73 |204.200000	207.680000	 by more than one million WordPress sites. |
|   74 |207.680000	210.520000	 So here again, WordPress, we just keep talking about this. |
|   75 |210.520000	214.720000	 And as everyone knows, I shut down mine |
|   76 |214.720000	218.260000	 because it's like, no, that's crazy to do that. |
|   77 |218.260000	224.640000	 And despite the fact that this was automatically remediated, |
|   78 |225.080000	228.760000	 some admins of their own sites complained |
|   79 |228.760000	230.920000	 about the fact that they were just saved. |
|   80 |230.920000	233.240000	 Anyway, we'll cut, we'll talk about that. |
|   81 |233.240000	234.760000	 We've got some miscellany, |
|   82 |234.760000	236.720000	 a bit of closing the loop feedback, |
|   83 |236.720000	239.360000	 and an update on where I stand with Spinrite. |
|   84 |239.360000	241.520000	 And then we're going to end by looking at |
|   85 |241.520000	244.880000	 the NSA's recently published list |
|   86 |244.880000	249.160000	 of the top 25 network vulnerabilities |
|   87 |249.160000	254.160000	 currently in use by malicious Chinese state actors |
|   88 |254.360000	256.560000	 to attack assets in the U.S. |

|    1 |- yo leo, great to be back with you again for episode 790. - wow. - our last episode of october, 2020. - wow. - and those who are watching the video will notice that i'm coming to everyone from our alternate location. i was working on the podcast like a couple hours to go and all of my connectivity disappeared. later, when i got over here, i logged on to cox, which is my cable motor provider, and i got a kick out of their notice. they said, we've noticed a temporary outage related to your internet, tv, and phone service. so first of all, they noticed a temporary outage. they noticed an outage, which they hope is temporary. and of course, i'm hoping that too. and they said the estimated time to repair for 13 p.m. so of course, we record this between 1.30 and 2.00 typically. we're pretty much wrapping up around that time. so i thought, i think maybe i need to, you know, set up the alternate location. so i did find something. - now in like a month or something, right? - yeah, yeah, yeah. and of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the us, i have no alternative provider. you know, i mean, they're nominally pretty good. but again, as you said, leo, it's getting to be like, okay, wait a minute. you know, on the other hand, we did go for 15 years without any trouble. although, remember the old days with two t1s? - oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - those were the days. anyway, two t1s. - the t1s, they gave you a fraction of the speed again with a single cable. - yes, exactly, exactly. the only thing i really had going for it was i had a lot of reliability. so because, yeah, back then it was, you know, a twisted pair and they were so expensive that it was a high priority to keep them up and running. - 1.44 megabits. - uh-huh. - ridiculous, why did we think that was a lot? - yeah. and i remember too, when i initially was like, back in the day when i was getting it, i would like mention that to people. this is when of course people had dial-up and they were like, "you have a t1?" oh, it's like, okay, yeah, yeah. fortunately, technology moves on. we got a bunch of stuff speaking of technology moving on to talk about. there's a recently patched zero day, which hit chrome only the third in a year. fortunately, chrome doesn't have many, but when it does, they tend to be significant because of course, as we know, it's the majority browser now on the internet. there's also a nice new feature that chrome is offering we'll talk about. we're going to take a look at site isolation, which is coming soon to firefox, and microsoft's announcement of edge for linux, which, okay, we'll talk about that. we've got some movement in the further decrecation of ie, of course, internet explorer, and a potentially massive sql injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million wordpress sites. so here again, wordpress, we just keep talking about this. and as everyone knows, i shut down mine because it's like, no, that's crazy to do that. and despite the fact that this was automatically remediated, some admins of their own sites complained about the fact that they were just saved. anyway, we'll cut, we'll talk about that. we've got some miscellany, a bit of closing the loop feedback, and an update on where i stand with spinrite. and then we're going to end by looking at the nsa's recently published list of the top 25 network vulnerabilities currently in use by malicious chinese state actors to attack assets in the u.s. |

|    1 |0.000000	8.800000	 Yo, Leo, great to be back with you again for episode 790, our last episode of October 2020. |
|    2 |8.800000	9.460000	 Wow. |
|    3 |9.460000	17.580000	 And those who are watching the video will notice that I'm coming to everyone from our alternate location. |
|    4 |17.580000	29.680000	 I was working on the podcast, like a couple hours to go, and all of my connectivity disappeared. |
|    5 |29.680000	39.100000	 Later, when I got over here, I logged on to Cox, which is my cable motor provider, and I got a kick out of their notice. |
|    6 |39.100000	46.080000	 They said, we've noticed a temporary outage related to your Internet, TV, and phone service. |
|    7 |46.080000	49.480000	 So, first of all, they noticed a temporary outage. |
|    8 |49.480000	55.380000	 They noticed an outage, which they hope is temporary, and, of course, I'm hoping that, too. |
|    9 |55.380000	59.660000	 And they said the estimated time to repair, 413. |
|   10 |59.660000	64.520000	 So, of course, we record this between 1.30 and 2.00 typically. |
|   11 |64.520000	67.320000	 We're pretty much wrapping up around that time. |
|   12 |67.320000	73.640000	 So, I thought, I think maybe I need to, you know, set up the alternate location. |
|   13 |73.640000	75.300000	 So, I did find something. |
|   14 |75.300000	77.280000	 That's right now in like a month or something, right? |
|   15 |77.280000	77.740000	 Yeah. |
|   16 |77.740000	78.720000	 Oh, man. |
|   17 |78.720000	79.460000	 Yeah. |
|   18 |79.460000	85.940000	 And, of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the U.S., I have no alternative provider. |
|   19 |85.940000	89.040000	 You know, I mean, they're nominally pretty good. |
|   20 |89.040000	89.580000	 But, again. |
|   21 |89.580000	92.020000	 As you said, Leo, it's getting to be like, okay, wait a minute. |
|   22 |92.020000	95.620000	 You know, on the other hand, we did go for 15 years without any trouble. |
|   23 |95.620000	98.920000	 Although, remember the old days with two T1s? |
|   24 |98.920000	100.260000	 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. |
|   25 |100.260000	101.880000	 Those were the days. |
|   26 |101.880000	102.960000	 Anyway. |
|   27 |102.960000	108.200000	 Two T1s, they gave you a fraction of the speed you're getting with a single cable. |
|   28 |108.200000	108.580000	 Yes. |
|   29 |108.580000	109.680000	 Exactly. |
|   30 |109.680000	110.640000	 Exactly. |
|   31 |110.640000	113.800000	 The only thing I really had going for it was I had a lot of reliability. |
|   32 |113.800000	117.340000	 So, because, yeah, back then, it was, you know, a twisted pair. |
|   33 |117.340000	119.260000	 And they were so expensive. |
|   34 |119.260000	122.940000	 They were so expensive that it was a high priority to keep them up and running. |
|   35 |122.940000	125.800000	 1.44 megabits. |
|   36 |125.800000	126.920000	 Uh-huh. |
|   37 |126.920000	127.860000	 Ridiculous. |
|   38 |127.860000	129.260000	 Why did we think that was a lot? |
|   39 |129.260000	130.360000	 Yeah. |
|   40 |130.360000	135.360000	 And I remember, too, when I initially was, like, back in the day when I was getting it, |
|   41 |135.360000	137.280000	 I would, like, mention that to people. |
|   42 |137.280000	139.420000	 This is when, of course, people had dial-up. |
|   43 |139.420000	143.060000	 And they were like, you have a T1? |
|   44 |143.060000	144.120000	 Oh. |
|   45 |144.120000	145.980000	 It's like, okay. |
|   46 |145.980000	146.860000	 Yeah. |
|   47 |146.860000	147.940000	 Yeah. |
|   48 |147.940000	148.320000	 I'm not. |
|   49 |148.320000	148.980000	 Unfortunately. |
|   50 |148.980000	150.440000	 Hopefully, technology moves on. |
|   51 |150.440000	152.460000	 We've got a bunch of stuff. |
|   52 |152.460000	160.140000	 Speaking of technology moving on to talk about, there's a recently patched Zero Day, which |
|   53 |160.140000	164.520000	 hit Chrome only the third in a year. |
|   54 |164.520000	166.600000	 Fortunately, Chrome doesn't have many. |
|   55 |166.600000	170.620000	 But when it does, they tend to be significant because, of course, as we know, it's the majority |
|   56 |170.620000	172.180000	 browser now on the Internet. |
|   57 |172.180000	177.400000	 There's also a nice new feature that Chrome is offering we'll talk about. |
|   58 |177.400000	178.960000	 We're going to take a look at Cytos. |
|   59 |178.960000	182.160000	 Which is coming soon to Firefox. |
|   60 |182.160000	189.620000	 And Microsoft's announcement of Edge for Linux, which, okay, we'll talk about that. |
|   61 |189.620000	196.960000	 We've got some movement in the further deprecation of IE, of course, Internet Explorer, and a |
|   62 |196.960000	206.260000	 potentially massive SQL injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million |
|   63 |206.260000	206.960000	 WordPress sites. |
|   64 |206.960000	208.320000	 So here again. |
|   65 |208.560000	210.460000	 WordPress, we just keep talking about this. |
|   66 |210.460000	218.060000	 And as everyone knows, I shut down mine because it's like, no, I'm just as crazy to do that. |
|   67 |218.060000	227.500000	 And despite the fact that this was automatically remediated, some admins of their own sites |
|   68 |227.500000	230.800000	 complained about the fact that they were just saved. |
|   69 |230.800000	232.860000	 Anyway, we'll talk about that. |
|   70 |232.860000	238.460000	 We've got some miscellany, a bit of closing the loop feedback, and an update on where I stand with |
|   71 |238.460000	238.920000	 Spinrite. |
|   72 |238.920000	247.380000	 And then we're going to end by looking at the NSA's recently published list of the top 25 network |
|   73 |247.380000	256.580000	 vulnerabilities currently in use by malicious Chinese state actors to attack assets in the U.S. |
