0.000000	8.000000	 - Yo, Leo, great to be back with you again for episode 790, our last episode of October
8.000000	9.000000	 2020.
9.000000	10.000000	 - Wow.
10.000000	16.600000	 - And those who are watching the video will notice that I'm coming to everyone from our
16.600000	19.920000	 alternate location.
19.920000	29.920000	 I was working on the podcast a couple hours to go, and all of my connectivity disappeared
29.920000	37.320000	 last, later, when I got over here, I logged on to Cox, which is my cable motor provider,
37.320000	39.240000	 and I got a kick out of their notice.
39.240000	46.200000	 They said, "We've noticed a temporary outage related to your internet, TV, and phone service."
46.200000	49.920000	 So first of all, they noticed a temporary outage.
49.920000	55.200000	 They noticed an outage, which they hope is temporary, and of course, I'm hoping that
55.200000	56.200000	 too.
56.200000	63.800000	 It's an estimated time to repair for 13 p.m., so of course, we record this between 1.30
63.800000	64.800000	 and 2.
64.800000	69.760000	 Typically, we're pretty much wrapping up around that time, so I thought, "I think maybe I need
69.760000	73.920000	 to set up the alternate location."
73.920000	74.920000	 So I did say something.
74.920000	77.680000	 - That's about now in like a month or something, right?
77.680000	78.680000	 - Yeah.
78.680000	79.680000	 - Oh, man.
79.680000	85.440000	 - Yeah, and of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the U.S., I have no alternative
85.440000	86.440000	 provider.
86.440000	90.760000	 You know, I mean, they're nominally pretty good, but again, as you said, Leo, it's getting
90.760000	92.200000	 to be like, "Okay, wait a minute."
92.200000	97.080000	 You know, on the other hand, we did go for 15 years without any trouble, although remember
97.080000	98.840000	 the old days with two T-1s?
98.840000	100.440000	 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
100.440000	102.400000	 - Those were the days.
102.400000	103.400000	 Anyway, two T-1s.
103.400000	108.320000	 - Two T-1s, it gave you a fraction of the speed you're getting with a single cable.
108.320000	109.320000	 - Yes.
109.320000	110.320000	 Exactly.
110.320000	111.320000	 Exactly.
111.320000	113.800000	 The only thing I really had going for it was I had a lot of reliability.
113.800000	114.800000	 - Liability, that's right.
114.800000	120.840000	 - Yeah, back then, it was, you know, a twisted pair, and they were so expensive that it was
120.840000	123.800000	 a high priority to keep them up and running.
123.800000	124.800000	 - 1.44 megabits.
124.800000	125.800000	 - Uh-huh.
125.800000	126.800000	 - Ridiculous.
126.800000	129.800000	 Why do we think that was a lot?
129.800000	130.800000	 - Yeah.
130.800000	136.320000	 And I remember, too, when I initially was like back in the day when I was getting it, I would
136.320000	137.320000	 like mention that to people.
137.320000	145.200000	 Well, this is when, of course, people had dial-up, and they were like, "You have a T-1?"
145.200000	150.480000	 That's like, "Okay, yeah, yeah, unfortunately, technology moves on."
150.480000	155.920000	 We've got a bunch of stuff, speaking of technology moving on to talk about.
155.920000	164.760000	 There's a recently patched zero-day, which hit Chrome only the third in a year.
164.760000	169.000000	 Fortunately, Chrome doesn't have many, but when it does, they tend to be significant
169.000000	173.760000	 because, of course, as we know, it's the majority browser now on the Internet.
173.760000	178.000000	 There's also a nice new feature that Chrome is offering we'll talk about.
178.000000	183.560000	 We're going to take a look at site isolation, which is coming soon to Firefox, and Microsoft's
183.560000	190.240000	 announcement of Edge for Linux, which, yeah, okay, we'll talk about that.
190.240000	197.360000	 You've got some movement in the further decoration of IE, of course, Internet Explorer, and a
197.360000	206.480000	 potentially massive SQL injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million
206.480000	207.480000	 WordPress sites.
207.480000	214.000000	 So, here again, WordPress, we just keep talking about this, and as everyone knows, I shut
214.000000	219.800000	 down mine because it's like, "No, I'm just this crazy to do that."
219.800000	227.520000	 And despite the fact that this was automatically remediated, some admins of their own sites
227.520000	230.720000	 complained about the fact that they were just saved.
230.720000	233.280000	 Anyway, we'll talk about that.
233.280000	237.760000	 We've got some miscellaneous, a bit of closing the loop feedback, and an update on where
237.760000	243.120000	 I stand with the spin-right, and then we're going to end by looking at the NSA's recently
243.120000	253.320000	 published list of the top 25 network vulnerabilities currently in use by malicious Chinese state
253.320000	256.600000	 actors to attack assets in the U.S.
