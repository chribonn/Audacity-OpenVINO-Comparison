0.000000	5.000000	 - Yo Leo, great to be back with you again for episode 790.
5.000000	6.760000	 - Wow.
6.760000	9.160000	 - Our last episode of October, 2020.
9.160000	10.120000	 - Wow.
10.120000	13.320000	 - And those who are watching the video will notice
13.320000	17.960000	 that I'm coming to everyone from our alternate location.
17.960000	24.840000	 I was working on the podcast like a couple hours to go
26.820000	30.040000	 and all of my connectivity disappeared.
30.040000	34.960000	 Later, when I got over here, I logged on to Cox,
34.960000	37.280000	 which is my cable motor provider,
37.280000	39.240000	 and I got a kick out of their notice.
39.240000	43.640000	 They said, we've noticed a temporary outage
43.640000	46.200000	 related to your internet, TV, and phone service.
46.200000	49.560000	 So first of all, they noticed a temporary outage.
49.560000	53.320000	 They noticed an outage, which they hope is temporary.
53.320000	55.720000	 And of course, I'm hoping that too.
55.720000	60.720000	 And they said the estimated time to repair for 13 p.m.
60.720000	65.120000	 So of course, we record this between 1.30 and 2.00 typically.
65.120000	67.440000	 We're pretty much wrapping up around that time.
67.440000	70.940000	 So I thought, I think maybe I need to, you know,
70.940000	73.840000	 set up the alternate location.
73.840000	75.680000	 So I did find something.
75.680000	77.480000	 - Now in like a month or something, right?
77.480000	79.600000	 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
79.600000	84.120000	 And of course, thanks to the nature of broadband in the US,
84.120000	86.720000	 I have no alternative provider.
86.720000	89.120000	 You know, I mean, they're nominally pretty good.
89.120000	90.400000	 But again, as you said, Leo,
90.400000	92.280000	 it's getting to be like, okay, wait a minute.
92.280000	93.400000	 You know, on the other hand,
93.400000	95.720000	 we did go for 15 years without any trouble.
95.720000	99.020000	 Although, remember the old days with two T1s?
99.020000	100.960000	 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
100.960000	102.680000	 - Those were the days.
102.680000	104.040000	 Anyway, two T1s.
104.040000	106.440000	 - The T1s, they gave you a fraction of the speed
106.440000	108.280000	 again with a single cable.
108.280000	111.240000	 - Yes, exactly, exactly.
111.240000	112.720000	 The only thing I really had going for it
112.720000	114.200000	 was I had a lot of reliability.
114.200000	116.600000	 So because, yeah, back then it was, you know,
116.600000	120.160000	 a twisted pair and they were so expensive
120.160000	123.640000	 that it was a high priority to keep them up and running.
123.640000	126.500000	 - 1.44 megabits.
126.500000	127.340000	 - Uh-huh.
127.340000	130.040000	 - Ridiculous, why did we think that was a lot?
130.040000	131.000000	 - Yeah.
131.000000	134.000000	 And I remember too, when I initially was like,
134.000000	135.680000	 back in the day when I was getting it,
135.680000	137.360000	 I would like mention that to people.
137.360000	139.720000	 This is when of course people had dial-up
139.720000	143.620000	 and they were like, "You have a T1?"
143.620000	148.540000	 Oh, it's like, okay, yeah, yeah.
148.540000	150.700000	 Fortunately, technology moves on.
150.700000	154.480000	 We got a bunch of stuff speaking of technology moving on
154.480000	155.580000	 to talk about.
155.580000	159.820000	 There's a recently patched Zero Day,
159.820000	164.820000	 which hit Chrome only the third in a year.
164.820000	166.680000	 Fortunately, Chrome doesn't have many,
166.680000	169.040000	 but when it does, they tend to be significant
169.040000	169.920000	 because of course, as we know,
169.920000	172.560000	 it's the majority browser now on the internet.
172.560000	175.680000	 There's also a nice new feature
175.680000	177.880000	 that Chrome is offering we'll talk about.
177.880000	180.240000	 We're going to take a look at Site Isolation,
180.240000	182.640000	 which is coming soon to Firefox,
182.640000	186.440000	 and Microsoft's announcement of Edge for Linux,
186.440000	190.160000	 which, okay, we'll talk about that.
190.160000	194.400000	 We've got some movement in the further decrecation of IE,
194.400000	196.140000	 of course, Internet Explorer,
196.140000	201.140000	 and a potentially massive SQL injection attack
201.140000	204.200000	 that was recently dodged
204.200000	207.680000	 by more than one million WordPress sites.
207.680000	210.520000	 So here again, WordPress, we just keep talking about this.
210.520000	214.720000	 And as everyone knows, I shut down mine
214.720000	218.260000	 because it's like, no, that's crazy to do that.
218.260000	224.640000	 And despite the fact that this was automatically remediated,
225.080000	228.760000	 some admins of their own sites complained
228.760000	230.920000	 about the fact that they were just saved.
230.920000	233.240000	 Anyway, we'll cut, we'll talk about that.
233.240000	234.760000	 We've got some miscellany,
234.760000	236.720000	 a bit of closing the loop feedback,
236.720000	239.360000	 and an update on where I stand with Spinrite.
239.360000	241.520000	 And then we're going to end by looking at
241.520000	244.880000	 the NSA's recently published list
244.880000	249.160000	 of the top 25 network vulnerabilities
249.160000	254.160000	 currently in use by malicious Chinese state actors
254.360000	256.560000	 to attack assets in the U.S.
