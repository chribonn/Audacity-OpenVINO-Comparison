11.560000	14.680000	 The story of Arthur the Rat.
14.680000	19.360000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his
19.360000	20.360000	 mind.
20.360000	23.760000	 Whenever his friends asked him, he would like to go out with them.
23.760000	26.200000	 He would only answer, "I don't know."
26.200000	29.640000	 He wouldn't say yes, and he wouldn't say no either.
29.640000	32.000000	 He would never learn to make a choice.
32.000000	37.680000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.
37.680000	40.680000	 You have no more mind than a blade of grass."
40.680000	43.880000	 Arthur looked wise but said nothing.
43.880000	48.560000	 One rainy day, the rats had a great noise in the loft where they lived.
48.560000	53.880000	 The pine rafters were all rotten, and the last one of the joys had given way and fall
53.880000	55.880000	 into the ground.
55.880000	62.080000	 They all shook, and all the rats had a hair stood on end with fear and horror.
62.080000	63.080000	 This ought to.
63.080000	64.360000	 The old rat was chief.
64.360000	68.320000	 I'll send out scouts to search for a new home.
68.320000	73.480000	 Three hours later, the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found a stone house,
73.480000	75.680000	 which is just what we wanted.
75.680000	79.120000	 There's room and good food for us all.
79.120000	85.640000	 There's a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden, and an elephant tree.
85.640000	87.880000	 But then the old rat got sight of young Arthur.
87.880000	90.040000	 Are you coming with us, Yars?
90.040000	91.040000	 I don't know.
91.040000	92.040000	 Arthur sighed.
92.040000	94.320000	 The roof may not come down just yet.
94.320000	99.600000	 Well, said the old rat angrily, "We can't wait all day for you to make up your mind.
99.600000	102.680000	 Right about face, much, and the vent of."
102.680000	106.400000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away.
106.400000	110.680000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
110.680000	114.160000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself.
114.160000	116.120000	 "I'll go back to make up my mind.
116.120000	122.040000	 That night there was a great crash to shoot here and down came the whole roof.
122.040000	124.960000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
124.960000	130.280000	 One of them moved aboard and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quiet dead,
130.280000	132.120000	 half in and half out of his hole."
