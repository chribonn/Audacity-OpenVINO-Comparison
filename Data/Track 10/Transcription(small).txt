10.000000	19.000000	 The story of Arthur the Rat. There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind.
19.000000	25.000000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, "I don't know."
25.000000	31.000000	 He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either. He could never learn to make a choice.
31.000000	40.000000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass."
40.000000	43.000000	 Arthur looked wise but said nothing.
43.000000	48.000000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived.
48.000000	55.000000	 The pine rafters were all rotten and at last one of the joys had given way and fallen to the ground.
55.000000	61.000000	 The wall shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
61.000000	68.000000	 This one too said, "The old rat was chief. I'll send out his scouts to search for a new home."
68.000000	75.000000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted.
75.000000	85.000000	 There's room and good food for us all. There's a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree."
85.000000	90.000000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. "Are you coming with us?" he asked.
90.000000	94.000000	 "I don't know," Arthur sighed. "The roof may not come down just yet."
94.000000	99.000000	 "Well," said the old rat angrily, "we can't wait all day for you to make up your mind."
99.000000	106.000000	 Right about phase, March, and they went off. Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away.
106.000000	110.000000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
110.000000	115.000000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself, "just to make up my mind."
115.000000	121.000000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof.
121.000000	124.000000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
124.000000	132.000000	 One of them moved aboard and under it there saw a young rat lying on his side, quiet dead, half in and half out of his hole.
