11.560000	14.660000	 The story of Arthur the Rat.
14.660000	19.700000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his
19.700000	20.700000	 mind.
20.700000	24.760000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer,
24.760000	26.180000	 "I don't know."
26.180000	29.640000	 He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either.
29.640000	32.040000	 He could never learn to make a choice.
32.040000	37.680000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.
37.680000	40.920000	 You have no more mind than a blade of grass."
40.920000	43.960000	 Arthur looked wise but said nothing.
43.960000	48.560000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived.
48.560000	54.080000	 The pine rafters were all rotten and at last one of the joys had given way and fallen to
54.080000	55.080000	 the ground.
55.080000	61.960000	 The wall shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
61.960000	64.960000	 This one too said the old rat was chief.
64.960000	67.760000	 I'll send out scouts to search for a new home.
67.760000	73.480000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found a stone house which
73.480000	75.040000	 is just what we wanted.
75.040000	78.400000	 There is room and good food for us all.
78.400000	84.840000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree.
84.840000	87.640000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur.
87.640000	89.040000	 "Are you coming with us?"
89.040000	90.040000	 he asked.
90.040000	91.520000	 "I don't know," Arthur sighed.
91.520000	93.640000	 "The roof may not come down just yet."
93.640000	99.640000	 "Well," said the old rat angrily, "we can't wait all day for you to make up your mind.
99.640000	100.640000	 Right about face.
100.640000	101.640000	 March."
101.640000	102.640000	 And they went off.
102.640000	106.420000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away.
106.420000	110.440000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
110.440000	116.100000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself, "just to make up my mind."
116.100000	122.000000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof.
122.000000	124.940000	 Next day someone rode up and looked at the ruins.
124.940000	130.200000	 One of them moved aboard and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead,
130.200000	132.160000	 half in and half out of his hole.
