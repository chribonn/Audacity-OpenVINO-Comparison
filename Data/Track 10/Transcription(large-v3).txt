10.040000	13.340000	 The story of Arthur the Rat
13.340000	19.440000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind.
19.440000	25.460000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, I don't know.
25.460000	28.540000	 He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either.
29.340000	31.140000	 He could never learn to make a choice.
31.140000	36.960000	 His aunt Helen said to him, no one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.
36.960000	39.800000	 You have no more mind than a blade of grass.
39.800000	42.600000	 Arthur looked wise but said nothing.
42.600000	47.580000	 One rainy day, the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived.
47.580000	54.580000	 The pine rafters were all rotten and at last one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground.
54.580000	58.880000	 The walls shook and all the rats' hair,
59.180000	61.180000	 which stood on end with fear and horror.
61.180000	64.100000	 Dysphonto said their old rat was chief.
64.100000	67.260000	 I'll send out scouts to search for a new home.
67.260000	71.360000	 Three hours later, the seven scouts came back and said,
71.360000	74.720000	 we have found a stone house which is just what we wanted.
74.720000	77.940000	 There is room and good food for us all.
77.940000	84.060000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden and an elm tree.
84.060000	87.560000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur.
87.560000	88.940000	 Are you coming with us?
89.320000	90.320000	 Nelly asked.
90.320000	91.680000	 I don't know, Arthur sighed.
91.680000	93.920000	 The roof may not come down just yet.
93.920000	96.360000	 Well, said the old rat angrily.
96.360000	99.260000	 We can't wait all day for you to make up your mind.
99.260000	102.200000	 Right about face, march, and they went off.
102.200000	105.480000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away.
105.480000	110.400000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
110.400000	115.440000	 I'll go back to my hole for a bit, he said to himself, just to make up my mind.
115.440000	118.840000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth.
119.120000	120.900000	 And down came the whole roof.
120.900000	124.000000	 Next day someone rode up and looked at the ruins.
124.000000	128.600000	 One of them moved aboard, and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side,
128.600000	132.140000	 quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
132.140000	133.240000	 Thank you.
