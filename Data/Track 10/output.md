|    2 |10.040000	13.340000	 The story of Arthur the Rat |
|    3 |13.340000	19.440000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind. |
|    4 |19.440000	25.460000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, "I don't know." |
|    5 |25.460000	28.540000	 He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either. |
|    6 |29.340000	31.140000	 He could never learn to make a choice. |
|    7 |31.140000	36.960000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. |
|    8 |36.960000	39.800000	 You have no more mind than a blade of grass." |
|    9 |39.800000	42.600000	 Arthur looked wise but said nothing. |
|   10 |42.600000	47.580000	 One rainy day, the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived. |
|   11 |47.580000	54.580000	 The pine rafters were all rotten and at last one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground. |
|   12 |54.580000	58.880000	 The walls shook and all the rats' hess hair, |
|   13 |59.180000	61.180000	 stood on end with fear and horror. |
|   14 |61.180000	64.100000	 "This won't do" said the old rat was chief. |
|   15 |64.100000	67.260000	 "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home." |
|   16 |67.260000	71.360000	 Three hours later, the seven scouts came back and said, |
|   17 |71.360000	74.720000	 "We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted. |
|   18 |74.720000	77.940000	 There is room and good food for us all. |
|   19 |77.940000	84.060000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden and an elm tree." |
|   20 |84.060000	87.560000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. |
|   21 |87.560000	88.940000	 "Are you coming with us?" |
|   22 |89.320000	90.320000	 he asked. |
|   23 |90.320000	91.680000	 "I don't know", Arthur sighed. |
|   24 |91.680000	93.920000	 "The roof may not come down just yet." |
|   25 |93.920000	96.360000	 "Well", said the old rat angrily, |
|   26 |96.360000	99.260000	 "We can't wait all day for you to make up your mind. |
|   27 |99.260000	102.200000	 Right about face, march", and they went off. |
|   28 |102.200000	105.480000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away. |
|   29 |105.480000	110.400000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him. |
|   30 |110.400000	115.440000	 I'll go back to my hole for a bit, he said to himself, just to make up my mind. |
|   31 |115.440000	118.840000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth. |
|   32 |119.120000	120.900000	 And down came the whole roof. |
|   33 |120.900000	124.000000	 Next day someone rode up and looked at the ruins. |
|   34 |124.000000	128.600000	 One of them moved a board, and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, |
|   35 |128.600000	132.140000	 quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. |

|   18 |67.760000	73.480000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found a stone house which |
|   19 |73.480000	75.040000	 is just what we wanted. |
|   20 |75.040000	78.400000	 There is room and good food for us all. |
|   21 |78.400000	84.840000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree. |
|   22 |84.840000	87.640000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. |
|   23 |87.640000	89.040000	 "Are you coming with us?" |
|   24 |89.040000	90.040000	 he asked. |
|   25 |90.040000	91.520000	 "I don't know," Arthur sighed. |
|   26 |91.520000	93.640000	 "The roof may not come down just yet." |
|   27 |93.640000	99.640000	 "Well," said the old rat angrily, "we can't wait all day for you to make up your mind. |
|   28 |99.640000	100.640000	 Right about face. |
|   29 |100.640000	101.640000	 March." |
|   30 |101.640000	102.640000	 And they went off. |
|   31 |102.640000	106.420000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away. |
|   32 |106.420000	110.440000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him. |
|   33 |110.440000	116.100000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself, "just to make up my mind." |
|   34 |116.100000	122.000000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof. |
|   35 |122.000000	124.940000	 Next day someone rode up and looked at the ruins. |
|   36 |124.940000	130.200000	 One of them moved aboard and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, |
|   37 |130.200000	132.160000	 half in and half out of his hole. |

|    1 |this recording was made on 11th october 1962 by a.k. srivastava for the phonetics department. the story of arthur the rat. there was once a young rat named arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind. whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, "i don't know." he wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either. he could never learn to make a choice. his aunt helen said to him, "no one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. you have no more mind than a blade of grass." arthur looked wise but said nothing. one rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived. the pine rafters were all rotten and at last one of the joys had given way and fallen to the ground. the wall shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror. this one too said the old rat was chief. i'll send out scouts to search for a new home. three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "we have found a stone house which is just what we wanted. there is room and good food for us all. there is a kindly horse named nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree. just then the old rat caught sight of young arthur.
