0.000000	7.000000	 The Internet Archive is an American non-profit organization founded in 1996 by Brewster Kala
7.000000	11.760000	 that runs a digital library website, archive.org.
11.760000	17.040000	 It provides free access to collections of digitized media including websites, software
17.040000	22.720000	 applications, music, audiovisual, and print materials.
22.720000	26.680000	 The archive also advocates a free and open Internet.
26.680000	31.140000	 Its mission is committing to provide universal access to all knowledge.
31.140000	35.760000	 The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its
35.760000	41.380000	 data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers,
41.380000	45.360000	 which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible.
45.360000	51.640000	 Its web archive, the Wayback Machine, contains hundreds of billions of web captures.
51.640000	57.200000	 The archive also oversees numerous book digitization projects, collectively one of the world's
57.200000	60.640000	 largest book digitization efforts.

67.860000	74.160000	 Brewster Kala founded the archive in May 1996, around the same time that he began the for-profit
74.160000	77.280000	 web-crawling company Alexa Internet.
77.280000	85.720000	 The earliest known archived page on the site was saved on May 10, 1996, at 2.42 pm UTC,
85.720000	88.400000	 7.42 am PDT.
88.400000	93.560000	 By October of that year, the Internet Archive had begun to archive and preserve the worldwide
93.560000	95.880000	 web in large amounts.
95.880000	101.720000	 The archived content became more easily available to the general public in 2001, through the
101.720000	103.720000	 Wayback Machine.
103.720000	109.920000	 In late 1999, the archive expanded its collections beyond the web archive, beginning with the
109.920000	111.680000	 Prelinger Archives.
111.680000	119.200000	 Now, the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software.
119.200000	124.880000	 It hosts a number of other projects, the NASA Images Archive, the Contract Crawling Service
124.880000	131.600000	 Archive IT, and the Wiki Editable Library Catalog and Book Information Site Open Library.
131.600000	136.520000	 Soon after that, the archive began working to provide specialized services relating to
136.520000	141.480000	 the information access needs of the print disabled; publicly accessible books were made
141.480000	148.120000	 available in a protected digital accessible information system (DAISY) format, according
148.120000	150.280000	 to its website.
150.280000	155.920000	 Most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their culture and heritage.
155.920000	160.880000	 Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its
160.880000	163.300000	 successes and failures.
163.300000	167.800000	 Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form.
167.800000	172.320000	 The archive's mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an Internet library
172.320000	176.120000	 for researchers, historians, and scholars.
176.120000	181.760000	 In August 2012, the archive announced that it had added BitTorrent to its file download
181.760000	188.360000	 options for more than 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files.
188.360000	193.320000	 This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the archive, as files are served
193.320000	198.440000	 from two archive data centers, in addition to other torrent clients which have downloaded
198.440000	201.220000	 and continue to serve the files.
201.220000	206.280000	 The Wayback Machine is fighting for universal access to quality information.
206.280000	211.840000	 The Internet Archive, which runs this project, relies on online donations averaging about
211.840000	214.920000	 $15 to help us keep the record straight.
214.920000	221.140000	 We'd be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially.
221.140000	225.840000	 We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute
225.840000	229.880000	 this Friday, we promise it will be put to good use.
229.880000	234.360000	 Our resources are crucial for knowledge lovers everywhere so if you find all these bits
234.360000	236.720000	 and bytes useful, please pitch in.
