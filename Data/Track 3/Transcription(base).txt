31.200000	35.760000	 The internet archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its
35.760000	41.440000	 data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers,

67.840000	73.640000	 Brewster Kala founded the archive in May 1996, around the same time that he began the
73.640000	77.320000	 for-profit web crawling company Alexa Internet.
77.320000	85.600000	 The earliest known archive page on the site was saved on May 10, 1996, at 242PMUTC,
85.600000	88.440000	 742AMPDT.
88.440000	93.640000	 By October of that year, the internet archive had begun to archive and preserve the worldwide
93.640000	95.920000	 web in large amounts.
95.920000	102.240000	 The archived content became more easily available to the general public in 2001, through the Wayback
102.240000	103.760000	 Machine.
103.760000	109.920000	 On late 1999, the archive expanded its collections beyond the web archive, beginning with the
109.920000	111.640000	 prelinger archives.
111.640000	119.200000	 Now, the internet archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software.

147.880000	153.440000	 According to its website, most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their
153.440000	155.880000	 culture and heritage.
155.880000	161.440000	 Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes
161.440000	163.280000	 and failures.
163.280000	167.800000	 Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form.
167.800000	172.320000	 The archive's mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an internet library
172.320000	176.120000	 for researchers, historians, and scholars.
176.120000	181.720000	 In August 2012, the archive announced that it had added BitTorrent to its file download
181.720000	188.320000	 options for more than 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files.
188.320000	193.320000	 This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the archive, as files are served
193.320000	198.400000	 from two archive data centers, in addition to other Torrent clients which have downloaded
198.400000	201.200000	 and continue to serve the files.
201.200000	206.240000	 The wayback machine is fighting for universal access to quality information.
206.240000	211.980000	 The internet archive, which runs this project, relies on online donations averaging about
211.980000	215.480000	 $15 to help us keep the record straight.
215.480000	221.120000	 We'd be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially.
221.120000	225.800000	 We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute
225.800000	229.880000	 this Friday, we promise it will be put to good use.
229.880000	234.360000	 Our resources are crucial for knowledge lovers everywhere so if you find all these bits
234.360000	236.740000	 and bites useful, please pitch in.
