0.000000	7.040000	 The Internet Archive is an American non-profit organization founded in 1996 by Brewster Kala
7.040000	11.760000	 that runs a digital library website, Archive.org.
11.760000	17.080000	 It provides free access to collections of digitized media including websites, software
17.080000	22.720000	 applications, music, audiovisual, and print materials.
22.720000	26.680000	 The Archive also advocates a free and open Internet.
26.680000	31.140000	 Its mission is committing to provide universal access to all knowledge.
31.140000	35.760000	 The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its
35.760000	41.400000	 data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers,
41.400000	45.360000	 which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible.
45.360000	51.640000	 Its Web Archive, the Wayback Machine, contains hundreds of billions of web captures.
51.640000	57.240000	 The Archive also oversees numerous book digitization projects, collectively one of the world's

67.760000	74.160000	 Brewster Kala founded the Archive in May 1996, around the same time that he began the for-profit
74.160000	77.280000	 web crawling company Alexa Internet.
77.280000	85.680000	 The earliest known archived page on the site was saved on May 10, 1996, at 2.42pm UTC,
85.680000	88.400000	 7.42am PDT.
88.400000	93.600000	 By October of that year, the Internet Archive had begun to archive and preserve the world-wide
93.600000	95.880000	 web in large amounts.
95.880000	101.720000	 The archived content became more easily available to the general public in 2001, through the
101.720000	103.720000	 Wayback Machine.
103.720000	109.920000	 In late 1999, the Archive expanded its collections beyond the Web Archive, beginning with the
109.920000	111.640000	 Prelinger Archives.
111.640000	119.200000	 Now, the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software.
119.200000	124.840000	 It hosts a number of other projects, the NASA Images Archive, the Contract Crawling Service
124.840000	131.600000	 Archive IT, and the WikiEditable Library Catalog and Book Information Site Open Library.
131.600000	136.560000	 Soon after that, the Archive began working to provide specialized services relating to
136.560000	141.900000	 the information access needs of the print-disabled, publicly accessible books were made available
141.900000	150.240000	 in a Protected Digital Accessible Information System (DAISY) format, according to its website.
150.240000	155.880000	 Most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their culture and heritage.
155.880000	160.840000	 Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its
160.840000	163.260000	 successes and failures.
163.260000	167.760000	 Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form.
167.760000	172.280000	 The Archive's mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an Internet library
172.280000	176.080000	 for researchers, historians, and scholars.
176.080000	181.720000	 In August 2012, the Archive announced that it had added BitTorrent to its file download
181.720000	188.320000	 options for more than 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files.
188.320000	193.280000	 This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the Archive, as files are served
193.280000	198.400000	 from two Archive data centers, in addition to other Torrent clients which have downloaded
198.400000	201.180000	 and continue to serve the files.
201.180000	206.240000	 The Wayback Machine is fighting for universal access to quality information.
206.240000	211.920000	 The Internet Archive, which runs this project, relies on online donations averaging about
211.920000	215.480000	 $15 to help us keep the record straight.
215.480000	221.120000	 We'd be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially.
221.120000	225.820000	 We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute
225.820000	229.880000	 this Friday, we promise it will be put to good use.
229.880000	234.520000	 Our resources are crucial for knowledge lovers everywhere so if you find all these bits and
234.520000	236.600000	 bytes useful, please pitch in.
