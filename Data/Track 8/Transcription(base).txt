11.000000	14.000000	 The story of Arthur the Rat.
14.000000	20.000000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind.
20.000000	26.000000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, "I don't know."
26.000000	32.000000	 He wouldn't say yes, and he wouldn't say no, either. He could never learn to make a choice.
32.000000	38.000000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.
38.000000	44.000000	 You have no more mind than a blade of grass." Arthur looked wise, but said nothing.
44.000000	49.000000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived.
49.000000	55.000000	 The pine rafters were all rotten, and at least one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground.
55.000000	61.000000	 The walls shook, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
61.000000	68.000000	 "This won't do," said the old rat who was chief, "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home."
68.000000	75.000000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted.
75.000000	84.000000	 There is room and good food for us all. There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree."
84.000000	90.000000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. "Are you coming with us?" he asked.
90.000000	95.000000	 "I don't know," Arthur sighed. "The roof may not come down just yet."
95.000000	100.000000	 Well, said the old rat angrily, "We can't wait all day for you to make up your mind."
100.000000	104.000000	 Right about face, march, and they went off.
104.000000	111.000000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away. The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
111.000000	117.000000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself, "just to make up my mind."
117.000000	122.000000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof.
122.000000	126.000000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
126.000000	135.000000	 One of them moved aboard, and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
135.000000	135.640000	 his whole.
