10.000000	13.360000	 The Story of Arthur the Rat
13.360000	19.400000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind.
19.400000	24.120000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer,
24.120000	29.000000	 "I don't know." He wouldn't say yes, and he wouldn't say no either.
29.000000	34.240000	 He could never learn to make a choice. His Aunt Helen said to him,
34.240000	40.360000	 "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass."
40.360000	43.480000	 Arthur looked wise, but said nothing.
43.480000	48.280000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived.
48.280000	55.200000	 The pine rafters were all rotten, and at least one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground.
55.200000	60.400000	 The walls shook, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
60.400000	67.280000	 "This won't do," said the old rat who was chief. "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home."
67.280000	71.520000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said,
71.520000	77.600000	 "We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted. There is room and good food for us all.
77.600000	84.560000	 There is a kindly horse named Nellie, a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree."
84.560000	88.040000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur.
88.040000	95.320000	 "Are you coming with us?" he asked. "I don't know," Arthur sighed. "The roof may not come down just yet."
95.320000	100.560000	 "Well," said the old rat angrily, "we can't wait all day for you to make up your mind.
100.560000	104.000000	 Right about face, march." And they went off.
104.000000	107.800000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away.
107.800000	111.600000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
111.600000	117.100000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself, "just to make up my mind."
117.100000	122.720000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof.
122.720000	126.160000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
126.160000	131.680000	 One of them moved aboard and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side,
131.680000	135.400000	 quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
