0.000000	6.040000	 Once there was a young rat named Arthur who could never make up his mind.
6.040000	10.700000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer,
10.700000	16.400000	 I don't know. He wouldn't say yes or no either. He could never learn to make a choice.
16.400000	21.800000	 His aunt Helen said to him, no one is going to care for you if you carry on like this.
21.800000	27.180000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where the pine rafters were all rotten.
28.060000	33.620000	 At last the joist gave way and fell to the ground. The walls shook and all the rat's hair stood on
33.620000	39.480000	 end with fear and horror. This won't do, said the captain. I'll send out scouts to search for a new
39.480000	45.420000	 home. Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, we have found just what we wanted,
45.420000	51.080000	 a stone house where there is room and good food for us all. There is a kindly horse named Nelly,
51.080000	57.920000	 a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree. Just then the old rat saw Arthur. Stop,
57.920000	65.000000	 he ordered coarsely. Are you coming? Of course, I suppose I ought, Arthur sighed. But the roof
65.000000	71.460000	 may not come down yet. Well, said the angry old rat, we can't wait all day for you. Right about
71.460000	78.020000	 face, march, and they went off. Arthur stood and watched them hurry away. The idea of an
78.020000	83.420000	 immediate decision was too much for him. Why do they have to go today, he said calmly to himself.
83.420000	87.120000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth.
87.120000	90.360000	 In the foggy morning, some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
90.360000	97.220000	 One of them moved aboard and saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
97.220000	113.940000	 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
