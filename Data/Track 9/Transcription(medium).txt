0.000000	3.920000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where the pine rafters were all rotten.
3.920000	6.760000	 At last the joist gave way and fell to the ground.
6.760000	10.440000	 When they heard that the rafters had fallen, the rafters couldn't take it any more.
10.440000	14.480000	 They tried to get the rafters to get up and run, but the rafters didn't want to do it any more.
14.480000	17.280000	 The rafters tried to get the rafters to stand up and run, but the rafters didn't want to do it any more.
17.280000	20.640000	 The rafters tried to get the rafters to stand up and run, but the rafters didn't want to do it any more.
20.640000	22.960000	 They tried to get the rafters to stand up and run, but the rafters didn't want to do it any more.
22.960000	28.000000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where the pine rafters were all rotten.
28.000000	30.840000	 At last the joist gave way and fell to the ground.
30.840000	35.720000	 The walls shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
35.720000	37.560000	 "This won't do," said the captain.
37.560000	41.040000	 "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home."
41.040000	45.840000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found just what we wanted.
45.840000	49.280000	 A stone house where there is room and good food for us all.
49.280000	55.080000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden with a gnome tree."
55.080000	61.400000	 Just then the old rat saw Arthur. "Stop," he ordered coarsely. "Are you coming?"
61.400000	67.120000	 "Of course I suppose I ought," Arthur sighed. "But the roof may not come down yet."
67.120000	74.920000	 "Well," said the angry old rat, "we can't wait all day for you. Right about face, march," and they went off.
74.920000	80.560000	 Arthur stood and watched them hurry away. The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
80.560000	84.560000	 "Why do we have to go today?" he said calmly to himself.
84.560000	87.600000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth.
87.600000	90.920000	 In the foggy morning some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
90.920000	99.200000	 One of them moved aboard and saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
99.200000	114.360000	 One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighty. Nineteen. Twenty.
