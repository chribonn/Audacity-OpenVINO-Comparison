2.000000	5.900000	 Once there was a young rat named Arthur who could never make up his mind
5.900000	11.580000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them. He would only answer. I don't know
11.580000	16.240000	 He wouldn't say yes or no either. He could never learn to make a choice
16.240000	21.680000	 His aunt Helen said to him no one is going to care for you if you carry on like this
21.680000	27.200000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where the pine rafters were all rotten
27.560000	34.760000	 At last the joist gave way and felt the ground the walls shook and all the rats hair stood on end with fear and horror
34.760000	39.680000	 This won't do to the captain. I'll send out scouts to search for a new home
39.680000	46.480000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said we have found just what we wanted a stone house
46.480000	48.480000	 Where there's room and good food for us all
48.480000	53.920000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly a cow a calf and a garden with an elm tree
54.760000	60.240000	 Just then the old rat saw Arthur stop. He ordered coarsely. Are you coming?
60.240000	63.120000	 Of course, I suppose I ought
63.120000	66.000000	 Arthur's side, but the roof may not come down yet
66.000000	73.720000	 Well, so do angry old rat. We can't wait all day for you right about face March and they went off
73.720000	79.720000	 Arthur stood and watched them hurry away. The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him
79.720000	83.400000	 Why do they have to go today? He said calm it himself
84.240000	88.520000	 That night was a great crash that shook the earth in the foggy morning
88.520000	94.880000	 Some men rode up and looked at the ruins one of them moved aboard and saw a young rat lying on his side quite dead
94.880000	97.440000	 Half in and half out of his hole
97.440000	106.080000	 One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
106.080000	112.080000	 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
