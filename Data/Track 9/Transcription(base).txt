0.000000	2.000000	 Snow low-marker song
2.000000	5.900000	 Once there was a young rap named Arthur who could never make up his mind
5.900000	9.440000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with him
9.440000	11.600000	 He would only answer "I don't know"
11.600000	14.000000	 He wouldn't say "yes" or "no" either
14.000000	16.560000	 He could never learn to make a choice
16.560000	18.900000	 His aunt Helen said to him
18.900000	21.700000	 "No one is going to care for you if you carry on like this"
21.700000	27.220000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where the pine rafters were all rotten
27.580000	34.700000	 At last the joist gave way and felt the ground the walls shook and all the rats hair stood on end with fear and horror
34.700000	39.700000	 This won't do to the captain. I'll send out scouts to search for a new home
39.700000	48.480000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said we have found just what we wanted a stone house where there's room and good food for us all
48.480000	54.180000	 There's a kindly horse named Nelly a cow a cow and a garden with an own tree
54.760000	60.240000	 Just then the old rats saw Arthur stop the audit costly. Are you coming?
60.240000	63.120000	 Of course I suppose I ought
63.120000	65.940000	 Officer, but the roof may not come down yet
65.940000	73.720000	 Welles of the angry old rat. We can't wait all day for you right about face March and they went off
73.720000	79.680000	 Arthur stood and watched him hurry away the idea of an immediate decision was too much for him
79.680000	83.320000	 Why do we have to go today? He said come it himself
84.280000	90.320000	 That night was a great crash that shook the earth in the foggy morning some men rode up and looked at the ruins
90.320000	94.880000	 One of them moved the board and saw a young rat lying on his side quite dead
94.880000	97.480000	 half in and half out of his hole
97.480000	106.080000	 One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
106.080000	112.260000	 eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
113.380000	114.380000	 Thank you.
