|    2 |7.080000	10.660000	 The story of Arthur the Rat |
|    3 |10.660000	16.480000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind. |
|    4 |16.480000	21.660000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, |
|    5 |21.660000	28.980000	 "I don't know." He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either. He could never learn to make a choice. |
|    6 |28.980000	41.900000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass." Arthur looked wise, but said nothing. |
|    7 |41.900000	65.280000	 One rainy day, the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived. The pine rafters were all rotten, and at last one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground. The walls shook and all the rats’ hair stood on  |
|    8 |end with fear and horror. "This won’t do," said the old rat who was chief, "I’ll send out scouts to search for a new home."  |
|    9 |65.280000	70.260000	 Three hours later, the seven scouts came back and said, |
|   10 |70.260000	76.940000	 "We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted. There is room and good food for us all. |
|   11 |76.940000	83.580000	 There is a kindly horse named Nellie, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree." |
|   12 |83.580000	87.380000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. |
|   13 |87.380000	90.280000	 "Are you coming with us?" he asked. |
|   14 |90.280000	95.580000	 "I don't know", Arthur sighed. The roof may not come down just yet. |
|   15 |95.580000	101.220000	 Well, said the old rat angrily, "We can't wait all day for you to make up your mind. |
|   16 |101.220000	106.120000	 Right about face. March." And they went off. |
|   17 |106.120000	109.880000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away. |
|   18 |109.880000	114.000000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him. |
|   19 |114.000000	117.360000	 I'll go back to my hole for a bit, he said to himself. |
|   20 |117.960000	119.440000	 Just to make up my mind. |
|   21 |119.440000	126.420000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof. |
|   22 |126.420000	130.100000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins. |
|   23 |130.100000	139.020000	 One of them moved a board and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. |

|    2 |7.080000	10.660000	 The story of Arthur the Rat |
|    3 |10.660000	16.480000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind. |
|    4 |16.480000	21.660000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, |
|    5 |21.660000	28.980000	 I don't know. He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either. He could never learn to make a choice. |
|    6 |28.980000	58.960000	 His aunt Helen said to him, |
|    7 |59.500000	65.280000	 This won't do, said the old rat who was chief. I'll send out scouts to search for a new home. |
|    8 |65.280000	70.260000	 Three hours later, the seven scouts came back and said, |
|    9 |70.260000	76.940000	 We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted. There is room and good food for us all. |
|   10 |76.940000	83.580000	 There is a kindly horse named Nellie, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree. |
|   11 |83.580000	87.380000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. |
|   12 |87.380000	90.280000	 Are you coming with us? he asked. |
|   13 |90.280000	95.580000	 I don't know, Arthur sighed. The roof may not come down just yet. |
|   14 |95.580000	101.220000	 Well, said the old rat angrily, we can't wait all day for you to make up your mind. |
|   15 |101.220000	106.120000	 Right about face. March. And they went off. |
|   16 |106.120000	109.880000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away. |
|   17 |109.880000	114.000000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him. |
|   18 |114.000000	117.360000	 I'll go back to my hole for a bit, he said to himself. |
|   19 |117.960000	119.440000	 Just to make up my mind. |
|   20 |119.440000	126.420000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof. |
|   21 |126.420000	130.100000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins. |
|   22 |130.100000	139.020000	 One of them moved a board and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. |
