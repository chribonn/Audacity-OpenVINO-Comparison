7.000000	11.000000	 The story of Arthur the Rat.
11.000000	16.500000	 There was once a young rat named Arthur who would never take the trouble to make up his mind.
16.500000	23.000000	 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with him, he would only answer, "I don't know."
23.000000	29.000000	 He wouldn't say yes and he wouldn't say no either. He could never learn to make a choice.
30.000000	38.000000	 His aunt Helen said to him, "No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass."
38.000000	41.000000	 Arthur looked wise but said nothing.
41.000000	46.000000	 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived.
46.000000	53.000000	 The pine rafters were all rotten and at last one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground.
54.000000	59.000000	 The walls shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
59.000000	66.000000	 "This won't do," said the old rat who was chief. "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home."
66.000000	74.000000	 Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, "We have found a stone house which is just what we wanted.
74.000000	77.000000	 There is room and good food for us all.
78.000000	84.000000	 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree."
84.000000	88.000000	 Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur.
88.000000	91.000000	 "Are you coming with us?" he asked.
91.000000	96.000000	 "I don't know," Arthur sighed. "The roof may not come down just yet."
96.000000	102.000000	 "Well," said the old rat angrily, "we can't wait all day for you to make up your mind."
102.000000	107.000000	 Right about face. March. And they went off.
107.000000	110.000000	 Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away.
110.000000	114.000000	 The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him.
114.000000	119.000000	 "I'll go back to my hole for a bit," he said to himself, "just to make up my mind."
119.000000	126.000000	 That night there was a great crash that shook the earth and down came the whole roof.
126.000000	130.000000	 Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins.
131.000000	139.000000	 One of them moved aboard and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
